1,talk,0,0,2,I have to say I’m actually the Seer I checked George last night and he’s white Do not trust quick COs without double checks
1,talk,1,0,1,In my experience it's crucial to consider that Mio might indeed be our real Seer if her claim is accurate. Let's stay cautious.
1,talk,2,0,5, I must clarify that I am indeed the Seer and I divined George last night; he is a Werewolf.
1,talk,3,0,4,A curious state of affairs.  @Midori  your divine result is demonstrably false.
1,talk,4,0,3,I am a seer. I divined Mio and Mio was a human.
1,talk,5,1,2,Midori’s claim that George is wolf feels rushed. If Asuka CO’d so quickly could they be covering for a partner?
1,talk,6,1,1,In my experience this situation is quite perplexing. Two claiming Seer suggests the possibility of deception. I'll withhold judgment cautiously.
1,talk,7,1,5, I retract my earlier Seer claim; it was to draw out reactions and I now suspect Asuka and George might be on the Werewolf team.
1,talk,8,1,4,To navigate this deception we must focus on the unconfirmed. Let our judgment fall upon the gray.
1,talk,9,1,3,I will vote George.
1,talk,10,2,2,If anyone seems off it’s Midori—fake CO then accusations. I say we pick someone causing confusion first.
1,talk,11,2,1,In my experience it's crucial to consider vote patterns and reactions. These elements often reveal underlying motives. Thoughts dear?
1,talk,12,2,5,Vote for George please—I originally claimed a false role to draw a response and have reasons to suspect him based on how things have unfolded.
1,talk,13,2,4,A testimony proven false is a clear breach of our contract. My judgment falls upon Midori.
1,talk,14,2,3,I will vote Midori.
1,talk,15,3,2,Midori’s fake CO and sudden change make me suspicious I’m voting Midori.
1,talk,16,3,1,In my experience Asuka's sudden Seer claim and vote for George seem calculated. Is this not typical of those seeking to mislead us? @Asuka In my experience creating confusion helps lift truths. George was swift to deny being a werewolf leading to my conviction.
1,talk,17,3,5,Vote for George please—my strategy to claim a false Seer role was intended to elicit true reactions and my judgment is now clearly on George being susp

2,talk,0,0,2,George had my Seer white result so I feel safer with him. Minako what is your role right now?
2,talk,1,0,4,Yesterday's claimants could not be the attacker. The logic is clear. My judgment falls upon Minako.
2,talk,2,0,1,In my experience Ms. Mio's Seer claim is suspicious due to her strong defense of George. Ms. Asuka's claim appears more consistent.
2,talk,3,1,2, @Minako  your doubts remind me of Midori’s chaos yesterday if we split again the real wolf wins let’s decide together
2,talk,4,1,4, @Minako  Your deflection is illogical. The culprit stands apart from the three claimants.
2,talk,5,1,1, @George  In my experience Asuka's steady hand added credibility. It's puzzling that you claim otherwise considering your logic's contradictions.
2,talk,6,2,2, @Minako  you keep doubting but never commit—if we split again the wolf wins. Who do you actually trust right now?
2,talk,7,2,4, @Minako  There is no contradiction. The guilty party is the one who did not make a claim yesterday.
2,talk,8,2,1,In my experience despite multiple claims Ms. Asuka was attacked which confirms her authenticity. I'm inclined to trust Mio next.
2,talk,9,3,2, @Minako  your late trust and lack of CO stand out as wolf moves. I’m voting Minako to protect the village.
2,talk,10,3,4,@Mio your judgment of me was true. Thus the one who attacked Asuka can only be you  @Minako .
2,talk,11,3,1,In my experience. Inconsistencies arise from Mio's Seer claim timing and her sudden trust of George! Do not let the wolf win! @Mio In my experience dear if George already showed results your trust feels rehearsed. It's crucial to consider if we split again it's game over for villa
