2,talk,37,3,7,I'm growing concerned my friend. Could Ms. Shizue be leading us astray? Her timing seems off. A typical wolf tactic perhaps. Stay alert! @Misaki Ms. Midori was human. Yet both Ms. May and Mr. Kenji voted Mr. Daisuke. Perhaps Ms. Shizue diverts from true targets? Any thoughts?

2,whisper,2,0,7,Might Mr. Mizuki's claims be influenced? Indeed those allied with him appear somewhat similar now. A reflection perhaps. @Minako Indeed my friend. Those aligning with Ms. Mizuki seem suspect. Yet our adversary desires illumination. Fear should not anchor us.

2,whisper,5,1,7,Indeed. Let's focus on Ms. Shizue. Her support for Mr. Benjamin could sway others against us. A united vote remains crucial my friend. @Minako Mr. Kenji's silence. Much like the stillness of a pond. Is it strategic? Perhaps. Risky? Indeed. Let's not turn a blind eye.
2,whisper,6,2,9,Yes Shizue is the correct target tonight. Tomorrow we must all vote for Kenji to secure our victory.

2,whisper,11,3,7,Ms. Shizue stands in clarity. Indeed with Ms. Mizuki and Mr. Kenji shadows abound. Time advances on decision. Silence may guide us. @Takumi Ms. Wizuki's claim. A clever facade perhaps. Does one suspect her lingering? Near truth or misdirection we must ponder.

3,talk,0,0,1,Hey there. Let's not bounce votes too much buddy. Sticking with known variables could help Milako out. Toshio's results are a bit murky.
3,talk,1,0,5,Good morning. Daisuke was executed — did he leave a will? Shizue was attacked last night — is she confirmed dead or left any message?  @Kenji  if you’re the seer please share your divination result now. If we have no hard info  let’s each name one suspect with a short reason. Over
3,talk,2,0,4,I will vote Toshio.
3,talk,3,0,9, @Mizuki  Shizue was attacked. We need your guidance. What are your findings for today?
3,talk,4,0,11,All vote outs so far have been villagers.  @Takumi  you follow every majority—who do you really suspect and why today?
3,talk,5,0,7,We must ponder Ms. Minako's vote on Mr. Daisuke. Perhaps Ms. Mizuki sways her. Mr. Takumi. How do you see her influence?
3,talk,6,0,13,I'm the seer — I divined Benjamin  George  and Shunichi as HUMAN. Wolves killed Shizue last night. With three cleared humans we need to narrow suspects f @Takumi  for being too quiet. Any role claims or strong objections? State your votes. Over
3,talk,7,0,8, @Kenji  your vote has jumped targets without much reasoning Should we focus on those acting outside Seer’s reads?
3,talk,8,0,6,I will vote Toshio.
3,talk,9,1,1,Hey there mate. We need to sort out these duplicate seer claims. Mizuki or Toshio's gotta go today. Confusion only aids the wolves.  @Mizuki  Let's stick to facts. Tell us why Toshio seems suspicious despite your readings. Clear reasoning helps buddy.
3,talk,10,1,5,Good morning. Did Daisuke leave a will? Is Shizue confirmed dead or did she leave any last words?  @Kenji  if you were the seer please share your divination now; if not  who do you suspect and why? Over
3,talk,11,1,4,Over
3,talk,12,1,9,If Mizuki is our real Seer then George and Shunichi are confirmed human.
3,talk,13,1,11,We’ve only executed humans so far we need stronger reasons before picking today’s target or wolves will win.
3,talk,14,1,7,Mr. Mizuki's seer claim does not align with the reports from Mr. George. Mr. Benjamin's accusation on me suggests caution perhaps.
3,talk,15,1,13,I'm the seer — I cleared Benjamin  George  and Shunichi. Wolves are still active. I'm voting  @Takumi  for being too quiet and evasive. Any role claims or strong objections? Vote now. Over
3,talk,16,1,8,If we trust Mizuki’s clears without question we risk wolves hiding easily. Who doubts her results and why?
3,talk,17,1,6,I will vote Toshio.
3,talk,18,2,1,Hey there mate. If Mizuki's divinations are on point George and I are definitely human. Taking out Toshio seems a wise strategic move.
3,talk,19,2,5,Good morning. Did Daisuke leave a will? Is Shizue confirmed dead or did she leave any message?  @Kenji  — please share your divination result now if you have one. If not  let’s each name one suspect quickly. Over
3,talk,20,2,9,Mizuki has given us two clears. Our choice must be from the unconfirmed players. Kenji seems best.
3,talk,21,2,11,Three humans in a row have been cleared or vote outd. Relying on that same logic is letting wolves hide among us.
3,talk,22,2,7,Ms. Mizuki indeed. If your vision is clear let us focus on Mr. Kenji. Does he merit defense? Mr. George your insights?
3,talk,23,2,13,I'm the seer — I cleared Benjamin  George  and Shunichi. Wolves are still active. I'm voting  @Takumi  for being too quiet and evasive. Any role claims or strong objections? Vote now. Over
3,talk,24,2,8,Before we trust all of Mizuki’s reads let’s reconsider Kenji’s behavior. His shifting votes aren’t adding up for me.
3,talk,25,2,6,I will vote Toshio.
3,talk,26,3,1,Hey there. Mizuki's clears are consistent. We should probe Kenji.  @Takumi  Three clears. Pivot to Kenji? His voting history might reveal something.
3,talk,27,3,5,Did Daisuke leave a will? Is Shizue confirmed dead or left any message?  @Kenji   your silence is worrying—if you’re the seer please reveal your divination now. If nobody has hard info  let’s each name one suspect quickly. Over
3,talk,28,3,9,I trust Mizuki's word. The danger must be one of the unconfirmed. Kenji's voting is suspicious. I vote Kenji.
3,talk,29,3,11,Midori was a villager per my medium check. I suspect Toshio or Kenji. I’ll vote Toshio unless someone convinces me otherwise.
3,talk,30,3,7,Is Ms. Misaki stalling or subtly swaying votes? Her lack of conviction could spell werewolf. We must question her motives closely.
3,talk,31,3,13,I'm the seer — I cleared Benjamin  George  and Shunichi. Wolves are still active after hitting Shizue. I'm suspicious of  @Takumi  for staying too quiet; unless someone gives a strong reason otherwise  I'll vote Takumi. Show your votes or role claims. Over
3,talk,32,3,8,Kenji’s pattern fits a lurker. If we trust Seer alone wolves coast. I’ll vote Kenji to break the pattern.
3,talk,33,3,6,I will vote Toshio.

3,whisper,0,0,9,We have reached a 4 vs 4 situation. A successful attack tonight guarantees our victory. Misaki claimed to be the Medium so she must be our target. Let's
3,whisper,1,0,8,Let’s target Misaki for tonight’s bite out. Keep all votes on Kenji now. Prepare to turn suspicion toward May next.
3,whisper,2,0,7,Ms. Misaki's claims could unsettle our plans. Shunichi is often in the shadows yet perhaps he holds a role. Let us focus on Ms. Misaki tonight.
3,whisper,3,1,9,Misaki's Medium claim makes her the clear target. Let's attack her tonight and secure our win.
3,whisper,4,1,8,Let’s bite out Misaki tonight to stop Medium info. For vote let’s all choose Kenji. If blocked target May next.
3,whisper,5,1,7,Mr. Tanaka. Misaki's claim. A risky move. Like balancing on a tightrope. Perhaps decisive action tonight. Dawn will tell.
3,whisper,6,2,9,The plan is set. We attack Misaki. Victory is at hand.
3,whisper,7,2,8,Let’s all vote Kenji today—I see no risk. For tonight we bite Misaki the Medium. If blocked we switch to May. Stay united.
3,whisper,8,2,7,Ms. Misaki's claim as Medium requires attention. She might verify her teammates. If our attack succeeds indeed victory is ours my friends.
3,whisper,9,3,9,Agreed. Misaki is the target. We attack her and secure victory tonight.
3,whisper,10,3,8,Let’s target Misaki for tonight’s bite out.
3,whisper,11,3,7,Mr. Tanaka's insight. Targeting Ms. Misaki and her Medium claim is a beacon of hope. The night unfolds. We are near indeed.

4,talk,2,0,6,Skip
4,talk,3,0,8,May hasn’t been cleared by the Seer and her votes are always safe. I want  @May  to explain her choices directly.
4,talk,4,0,13,I divined Benjamin  George  and Shunichi as HUMAN. Wolves still active after Misaki was attacked. I'm voting  @Takumi  for being quiet and evasive. Any role claims or strong objections? Vote now. Over
4,talk,5,0,1,Hey there mate. Looks like Mizuki's feeling the heat with all those seer claims. Takumi? Still lurking in the shadows silently eh?
4,talk,6,0,7,Ms. May's actions perhaps cast a shadow on our trust. Without clear reasoning logic guides us like a calm river—steady and true.
4,talk,7,1,5,Good morning. Did Kenji leave a will? Is Misaki confirmed dead or did she leave any last words?  @May  — if you’re the seer  please share your divination now; if not  who do you suspect and why? I’m still wary of Shunichi. Over
4,talk,8,1,9,I understand the suspicion Mizuki. My vote is for May because she has been too quiet.
4,talk,9,1,8, @May  you’ve been very quiet each time someone was under suspicion. Why not speak up more about your thoughts now?
4,talk,10,1,13,I divined Benjamin  George  and Shunichi as HUMAN. Wolves hit Misaki last night. I'm voting  @Takumi  for being too quiet—any role claims or objections? Vote now. Over
4,talk,11,1,1,Hey there mate. This silence is quite eerie. I'd nudge Minako. Your insights have been sharp so far. Spot any suspicious fish?
4,talk,12,1,7, @May . It is curious you remain silent when clarity beckons. Perhaps your silence serves a purpose. Time to speak my friend.
4,talk,13,2,5,Did Kenji leave a will? Is Misaki confirmed dead or left any message?  @May  please reveal your divination now — if you’re not the seer  I’m starting to suspect Shunichi; he’s been very quiet when pressed. Let’s hear from others
4,talk,14,2,9,Let's be clear. The choice is between me or May. I have explained my votes but May has not.
4,talk,15,2,8,May’s silence is hurting us. If you’re a villager speak up or risk my vote—we need everyone’s input now.
4,talk,16,2,13,I divined Benjamin  George and Shunichi as HUMAN. Wolves hit Misaki last night. I'm voting  @Takumi  for being too quiet and inconsistent — any role claims or strong objections? Over
4,talk,17,2,1,Hey there mate. I reckon Mizuki's our sole seer standing now since Toshio's claim's off. Let's prod May or Takumi a bit more yeah?
4,talk,18,2,7,I am skeptical of Ms. May's silence. Perhaps we should divine her tonight. It might reveal much about her intentions. Indeed.
4,talk,19,3,5,Did Kenji leave a will? Is Misaki confirmed dead or left any last words?  @May  — please share your divination result now. You’re looking suspicious to me; if you can’t provide proof I may vote for you. Over
4,talk,20,3,9,Mizuki suspects me but May's silence is a greater threat. My vote remains on May for the good of all.
4,talk,21,3,8,I’m voting May. At this stage silence is our biggest risk. May if you’re innocent say something now—time’s up.
4,talk,22,3,13,I divined Benjamin  George  and Shunichi as HUMAN. Wolves hit Misaki last night. I'm voting  @Takumi  — he's been too quiet and inconsistent. Any role claims or objections? Vote now. Over
4,talk,23,3,1,Hey there mate. Mizuki's on repeat with those players. But May? Your silence is deafening. Villager or a special role mate? Your voice would help us.
4,talk,24,3,7,Mr. Takumi. I note your vote shift raises an eyebrow. May. More suspicious. Why so? Let's pause and discuss your perspective.
4,whisper,0,0,7,I believe Mr. Benjamin is indeed the true seer. Perhaps under bodyguard's watch. Ms. Mizuki's words echo this thought. Attacks may falter.
4,whisper,1,0,9,We win today. It is 4 vs 3. All of us must vote for May. Do not falter. Tonight's attack will be on George.
4,whisper,2,0,8,Let’s all vote May today stay unified. For night bite out I suggest George unless things shift last minute.
4,whisper,3,1,7,Mr. George must be approached with caution tonight. His silence unbroken might become our ally or our undoing. Yes indeed?
4,whisper,4,1,9,Agreed. A united vote on May wins us the game today. We attack George tonight. Victory is close.
4,whisper,5,1,8,Let’s all vote  @May  today. After that let’s bite out George tonight for maximum impact. Stick together and don’t get split.
4,whisper,6,2,7,Ah with Mr. George and Ms. May unaware tonight appears favorable for strategy. Ms. Mizuki skillfully divides them indeed. @Minako My friends. Let us remain vigilant tonight. Mr. George has been silent. Ms. Misaki holds much wisdom. Yet. A fresh dawn approaches.
4,whisper,7,2,9,Victory is certain if we all vote for May today. Do not hesitate.
4,whisper,8,2,8,Let’s all vote May today then bite George tonight. If there’s trouble or a surprise claim Takumi can fake CO. Agreed?
4,whisper,9,3,7,Let us tread carefully today my friend. Tensions fluctuate like reeds in the wind. We focus our votes on Ms. May. Mr. George? Indeed victory nears.
4,whisper,10,3,9,Our plan is solid. All votes on May. Let us finish this together.
4,whisper,11,3,8,Let’s all vote @May today and bite  @George  tonight. No need for fake claims unless we’re pushed.
