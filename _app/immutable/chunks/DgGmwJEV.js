1,talk,1,0,7,Good morning. I still have no special info. We lost Benjamin — I hope he wasn't a seer.  @Asuka  if you are seer please share any result  or at least tell us who you suspect. I'm uneasy about Shizue; she pushed hard for Benjamin. Quick one-line reads\r

1,talk,5,0,12,Hey darling! I'm super curious why Asuka chose Sakura! Are there any cool observations you've got? Votes should be well thought out right?\r
1,talk,6,0,4, @Asuka  you voted Sakura immediately Explain your suspicion Werewolves rush decisions so slow down and give your reasoning\r
1,talk,7,0,5,Hey buddy! Voting's no fun without a splash of reason! What do you say Asuka? Why am I fishy huh? Let's dig for clues together!\r
1,talk,8,0,11,Asuka your accusation lacks foundation. A Seer should present their findings before we proceed.\r
1,talk,9,0,2,I divined Benjamin and maybe... he's a Werewolf. I wonder if we should consider him for today's vote buddy. What do you think?\r

1,talk,16,1,3, @Minato  you claim Seer and named Benjamin as wolf—why pick him for divination? Let’s hear your logic before we vote.\r
1,talk,17,1,10,Interesting Minato would choose me as first divination target. That feels like a calculated wolf move not real Seer logic.\r
1,talk,18,1,12,Sounds like Minato might be our seer if he's right about divining you! We should be cautious buddy.  @Benjamin  You're feeling wolf vibes?\r
1,talk,19,1,4, @Minato  if no one else COs seer then Benjamin is most suspicious now. Anyone want to counterclaim or oppose?\r
1,talk,20,1,5,Hey buddies! Mr. Minato said Benjamin's a wolf after divining. I'll wait for you both to share! Ms. Minato. Why Benjamin first?\r
1,talk,21,1,11,Minato's claim is noted. His choice of Benjamin as a divine target however lacks a clear rationale.\r
1,talk,22,1,2,I think maybe for tonight's divine we should focus on Rin or Victoria. Benjamin's role seems clear don't you think?\r

1,talk,29,2,3, @Asuka  you’ve switched votes without reasons. Are you distracting us or hiding something? Give a real explanation.\r
1,talk,30,2,10,Minato naming me as wolf feels too easy. Why not pick someone sneakier? I don’t buy it—let’s not rush this vote.\r
1,talk,31,2,12,Hey darlings! I'm kinda thinking Benjamin might be a bit sus. Minato's divination seems so true. What are your thoughts buddies?\r
1,talk,32,2,4,Minato CO’d seer and named Benjamin as wolf. Unless someone else claims seer shouldn’t we vote Benjamin today?\r
1,talk,33,2,5,Hey buddies! Minato played seer and spotted Benjamin as a wolf! Maybe it's a good idea to join in this time! What do you all think?\r
1,talk,34,2,11,Let us consider our adversaries' contract. Is it truly their design to be found so easily?\r
1,talk,35,2,2,I wonder if Benjamin's doubt about my divination might mean something more. Hmm. Jonathan. What's your take on Asuka's quick vote switches?\r

2,talk,17,1,4, @Victoria  your voting makes no sense and you avoid explaining. Right now you seem most wolf-like.\r

3,talk,6,0,4, @Sakura  your shift from supporting me to calling me “fishy” is abrupt. Can you explain what changed your mind?\r
3,talk,7,0,13,I speak to spirits. Benjamin was wolf. Victoria was wolf. Minato's nose was true.\r
3,talk,8,0,12,Hey buddy! George is acting super shady huh? Targeting Shizue a lot might be his way of covering up. What do you think?\r
3,talk,9,1,8,Oh dear—so many gone.  @Asuka  please share your divination result now; we need guidance. I'm uneasy about Mizuki—she seems very calm. Could everyone give a one-line read so we vot\r
3,talk,10,1,3, @George  two wolves are gone and Minato’s results are solid so why do you still push suspicion onto Shizue?\r
3,talk,11,1,11,Takumi's report confirms Minato's claims. By this logic Asuka is human. We should trust this fact.\r
3,talk,12,1,5,We should trust Minato's words! They divined Benjamin and Victoria as wolves. Asuka might be truthful if she's with Minato!  @Mizuki  Oopsies friend-o! Things got twisty after Asuka's actions felt strange. Trying to figure out friends and wolves is tricky fun!\r
3,talk,13,1,6,I will vote Jonathan.\r

3,talk,15,1,4,George keeps going after Shizue even after two wolves were confirmed.\r
3,talk,16,1,13,Minato saw Asuka is human. But she moves with wolves. She is bad human. I hunt Asuka today.\r
3,talk,17,1,12,Minato's vision is still strong huh? With Victoria in the mix we're hunting Asuka next? Her moves are so sketchy! Yaay! You know  @George  you've been super tough on Shizue. Since Minato's claim got confirmed don't you think it's time to focus on the others? What's your take on this buddy?\r
3,talk,18,2,8,Oh dear—I'm so sad about all these losses.  @Asuka  please tell us your divination result now; we really need guidance. I'm a bit uneasy about Mizuki—she seems very calm. Could everyone give a one-line\r
3,talk,19,2,3, @George  you keep pushing Shizue despite evidence—give us real reasons or you’ll be my vote today.\r
3,talk,20,2,11,A confirmed human who creates disarray is a liability. My vote will be for Asuka.\r
3,talk,21,2,5,With both wolfies Minato divined gone let's skip over to Mizuki! Time to cut down suspect lists by votes! Yay buddy!\r
3,talk,22,2,6,I will vote Jonathan.\r

3,talk,24,2,4, @George  you still target Shizue even after two wolves were found. Why ignore new info? That’s suspicious to me.\r
3,talk,25,2,13, @George  Spirits say truth. Minatos nose good. Why you hunt Shizue? You help the last wolf.\r
3,talk,26,2,12,Hmm maybe George is kinda suspicious now? He’s all about Shizue despite Minato's proof huh? What if Jonathan's the werewolf buddy?\r
3,talk,27,3,8,Oh dear  I'm so saddened by our losses. I'm uneasy about  @Mizuki  — she seems very calm. Could the seer please share their result? If no clear info soon  perhaps we should consider voting for a quiet player. One-line re\r
3,talk,28,3,3,I’m voting  @George . Stubbornly ignoring confirmed wolves and shifting blame is classic wolf behavior—no more distractions.\r
3,talk,29,3,11,Though human Asuka's chaotic votes undermine our contract. Her removal is logical.\r
3,talk,30,3,5,Hey there how about giving Ms. Mizuki a go now? George you're still on Shizue even with Minato’s proofs? Let's explore new paths buddy!\r
3,talk,31,3,6,I will vote Jonathan.\r

3,talk,33,3,4,After both wolves were exposed only George kept tunneling old suspicions so I will vote George as the last wolf.\r
3,talk,34,3,13,Minato saw Asuka is human. But she is bad human. A traitor. I hunt Asuka today.\r
3,talk,35,3,12,Minato's info is spot on! Let's laser-focus on Asuka! Her chaos is trouble buddy! Jonathan how's your logic game? Let's ace this!\r
