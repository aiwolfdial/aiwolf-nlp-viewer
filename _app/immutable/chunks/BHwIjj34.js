0,whisper,0,0,3,Hello. I am Shizue. My role is werewolf. Have a good game.\r
0,whisper,1,0,1,At the risk of stating the obvious we should focus on Asuka or Benjamin tonight. They might be special roles. Any thoughts?\r
0,whisper,2,0,2,Misaki looked at Asuka and Benjamin thoughtfully. If it's alright Ms. Asuka seems protective. Mr. Benjamin has a bold aura... perhaps a seer?\r
0,whisper,3,1,3,Over\r
0,whisper,4,1,1,Well at the risk of stating the obvious I suspect Asuka is our bodyguard. If I may be so bold? Benjamin strikes me as the seer. Caution is wise.\r
0,whisper,5,1,2,Mr. Benjamin might be a key target tonight. If it's alright perhaps Asuka won't protect him. A calculated move I think.\r
0,whisper,6,2,1,I must say I concur with Misaki's insight. If Benjamin is indeed the seer removing him might just serve us quite well.\r
0,whisper,7,2,2,I agree. Mr. Benjamin is a key target. If it's alright with Ms. Asuka likely as bodyguard our advantage grows by removing threats.\r
0,whisper,8,3,1,Benjamin seems a strategic target. With Asuka possibly focused elsewhere the path might just open up. At the risk of stating the obvious! @Shizue At the risk of stating the obvious. If questioned. We must maintain our cover as villagers. I am but a humble villager myself.\r

1,talk,13,1,4,Jonathan's conclusion is erroneous. Takumi's assessment aligns with reality. Analyze from this premise.\r

1,talk,28,2,3,I will vote Jonathan.\r
1,talk,29,2,2,If it's alright perhaps we should focus on Mr. Shunichi. Divining him could clarify things. Any thoughts on this approach?\r
1,talk,30,2,5,Voting Asuka gives us a clear test—let’s find out which Seer is real right now!\r
1,talk,31,2,1,At the risk of stating the obvious targeting Asuka could unveil which of Jonathan or Takumi may truly hold the Seer's mantle. Caution is key.\r

1,talk,33,2,8,I will vote Jonathan.\r
1,talk,34,2,6,Voting Asuka is a high-risk gamble. The logical move is to eliminate a silent subject like Victoria.\r

1,talk,41,3,3,I will vote Asuka.\r
1,talk,42,3,2,Mr. Takumi. You claim innocence. Yet align with wolves' sneaky paths. Offering fake certainty is risky. Let's clarify today. @Takumi Why would you claim Seer Mr. or Ms. [name]? Wolves tend to fake roles. Do you fear being exposed perhaps? Please clarify.\r
1,talk,43,3,5,I’m voting Asuka—the outcome will show if Takumi or Jonathan is truthful and expose the wolves hiding among us.\r
1,talk,44,3,1,Voting for Takumi seems the safer move. I must say his late claim challenges Jonathan who dared to share first. Trust his timing? @Jonathan If I may be so bold Takumi's wolf claim on Asuka raises a question: why wait until danger looms to reveal? Perhaps stay wary?\r
1,talk,45,3,9,I’m voting Jonathan. His accusation rings hollow and removing him should clear up the Seer mess for us all.\r

1,whisper,1,0,2,Mr. Jonathan claims that Ms. Asuka is a werewolf. Perhaps he's possessed or just testing reactions. If it's alright let’s be wise. @Shunichi Mr. Jonathan's claim feels a bit questionable. Perhaps we should be a bit careful in trusting it too quickly. What do you think?\r

1,whisper,4,1,2,Mr. Takumi is likely the seer. His claim about divining Ms. Asuka seems thoughtful. Perhaps we should consider his protection tonight? @Shunichi If it's alright shall we talk about Mr. Takumi's seer-like claim? Perhaps we can discuss how to handle his bodyguard protection.\r

1,whisper,7,2,2,If it's alright. I feel targeting Mr. Benjamin is wise. Servas feels unpredictable too. Perhaps we should consider options tonight. @Shunichi Mr. Takumi favoring Asuka. That might mean he's not a seer. If it's alright. Let's be cautious around him. What do you think?\r
1,whisper,8,3,1,If I may be so bold. Strategy-wise Servas introduces a delightful unpredictability. A potential key target quite soon wouldn't you agree? @Misaki Takumi's claim stands on firm ground. If I may be so bold Servas should be observed closely. Let's focus on logical strategies.\r

2,whisper,7,2,2,If it's alright. Mr. Benjamin seems suspicious. Perhaps with his roles he might destabilize our plans if left unchecked. @Shizue If it's alright. Ms. Rin being medium-like can be troubling. Focus on Mr. Benjamin first. Perhaps Midori later for flexibility.\r
