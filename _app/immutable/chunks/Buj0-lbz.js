1,talk,1,0,3, My claim is Seer. Last night I divined Shizue as a Werewolf. I vote to exile Shizue to protect our village.\r
1,talk,2,0,2,I claim Seer. N0: Shizue=Human. Midori's claim is false (wolf/poss). Shizue claim. Servas state role and vote plan. @Victoria Understood. Report: N0 Shizue=Human. I refute Midori and plan to push Midori today absent a persuasive counter.\r
1,talk,3,0,4,Midori’s claim that I am a werewolf is false. If I go vote outd please question her and ask Servas to speak up.\r
1,talk,4,0,1,I am the Seer. My divination aligns with Midori's. Shizue is the Werewolf.\r
1,talk,5,1,5,Final vote: Servas. Three seer claims conflict: Asuka N0 Shizue=Human vs Midori/Servas Shizue=Werewolf.  @Servas  state your divination target  night number  and exact result now; failure to do so confirms inconsistency. Others: one-sentence final vote. Over\r
1,talk,6,1,3, I retract my Seer claim as I've uncovered suspicious behavior in Servas. His conflicting alignment supports suspicions.\r
1,talk,7,1,2,Skip\r
1,talk,8,1,4,Midori and Servas both accuse me as wolf which feels too coordinated I’ll support voting Servas today for our safety\r
1,talk,9,1,1,Midori's contract is broken. Such wavering reveals deceit. Let us instead turn our judgment to Victoria.\r
1,talk,10,2,5,Final vote: Servas.  @Servas  your claim and results are inconsistent — you aligned with Midori on Shizue then switched to accuse Victoria; provide night number and exact divinat\r
1,talk,11,2,3,Let's vote for Servas today. His flip between supporting my previous Seer claim and then changing his target is inconsistent and suspicious.\r
1,talk,12,2,2,Seer here. N0 Shizue=Human. Midori retracted; two fake COs imply Servas=Wolf Midori=Poss. I will vote Servas today. @Servas State your N0 target and exact result. Your shifts and no specifics read as wolf. Absent clarity my vote stays on you.\r
1,talk,13,2,4,I vote for Servas today. If Servas is the wolf let’s focus on Midori next and watch voting patterns closely.\r
1,talk,14,2,1,Why does Midori's retraction make Asuka true? This logic is flawed. Perhaps the real wolf feigns order.\r
1,talk,15,3,5,I vote  @Servas . Your seer claim is inconsistent—declare each divination as "Night X: Target=Result" and explain why you switched from accusing Shizue to Victori\r
1,talk,16,3,3,Let's vote for Servas today. His inconsistent actions and voting aims to mislead us which is suspicious. His shift in targets strengthens this suspi\r
1,talk,17,3,2,Final vote: Servas. His CO is inconsistent lacks night/result specifics and shifts targets. If wrong check Midori next. @Servas Final vote on you. Provide exact N0 record now: 'N0 Target=Result'. Your refusal confirms my read.\r
1,talk,18,3,4,I’m voting Servas today; if he isn’t the wolf let’s watch Midori next—her change in claims worries me for our village.\r

2,talk,1,0,2,Report: N1 Victoria is Werewolf. NK after Servas shows he was not wolf. Execute Victoria. Midori state your vote. @Midori  my N1 found Victoria is Werewolf. Servas was not wolf if NK happened. Please vote Victoria now.\r

2,talk,3,1,5,Final vote:  @Midori . Facts: Midori claimed Seer and divined Shizue=Werewolf; Asuka reported N0 Shizue=Human; wolves killed Shizue at night  which contradicts Midori\r
2,talk,4,1,2,At 3p follow Seer. N1 result: Victoria=Werewolf. Servas not wolf since NK occurred. Execute Victoria today. Midori commit. @Midori  place your vote on Victoria now. My N1: Victoria=Werewolf. We need 2 votes at 3p. I will finalize on Victoria.\r
2,talk,5,1,3,Asuka let's vote out Victoria today. Your divination last night pointed to her as the Werewolf. This is crucial for our victory.\r

2,talk,7,2,2,Final vote: Victoria. Reason: N1 divined Victoria=Werewolf; NK shows Servas not wolf. Midori finalize on Victoria; we win. @Midori @Midori I lock vote on Victoria per N1: Victoria=Werewolf. Please finalize on Victoria now.\r
2,talk,8,2,3, Asuka I finalized my vote on Victoria as you suggested. We need to stand together and make this count for the village's safety.\r

2,talk,10,3,2,My vote stays on Victoria. Evidence: N1 divined Victoria=Wolf; NK confirms Servas not wolf. No counterclaim. Execute now. @Victoria  give a clear defense: Why would Seer see you wolf and wolves kill Shizue? If none I proceed to execute.\r
2,talk,11,3,3, Victoria I encourage Asuka to keep her vote on you based on her divination as Werewolf. This is vital for village survival.\r
