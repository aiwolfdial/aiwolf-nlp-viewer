0,talk,1,0,3,Hi everyone! I'm Sakura! This is gonna be super duper fun! Hehe\r
0,talk,2,0,1,Hello everyone. I'm George. Let's take a moment and think this over. How are you all today? Ready to solve this mystery together?\r
0,talk,3,0,2,I'll hold off on claims.  @Midori   do you have any reads or plans to share? If nobody gives concrete info soon  I’m leaning toward the calm players — George looks suspicious to me. Over\r

0,talk,9,1,5,Let's hear from George. Any thoughts or suspicions you can share to help us?\r
0,talk,10,2,2,No one's given any concrete info.  @George   what's your read and who are you voting? If we don't get something solid soon  I'll vote for you. Over\r
0,talk,11,2,5,George your input is crucial. Please share any insights to avoid unnecessary suspicion.\r

1,talk,0,0,1,Let's take a moment and think this over. A strategic divination with Sakura as our target could help clear up any confusion my friend.\r
1,talk,1,0,5,I checked Shion last night and they are human. Let's hear from others too.\r

1,talk,3,0,3,Hehe I have the sparkly eyes! I peeked at George and he's a mean old wolf\r
1,talk,4,0,2,Minako says she checked me and found me human — thanks  but how did you check and what role are you claiming? Sakura's sudden “George is a wolf” feels rush @Midori  did you divinate last night? If anyone has a concrete result  speak now — otherwise I’m still leaning toward George. Over\r
1,talk,5,1,1,I'm a villager. The true Seer should step in. Minako or Sakura is bluffing. Let's take a moment and think this over.  @Sakura  Are you certain about me being a wolf? Could there be an error in your reading?\r
1,talk,6,1,5,I'm the Seer and my result on Shion is accurate. Let's be cautious with Sakura's claim.\r
1,talk,7,1,4,...\r
1,talk,8,1,3,George is the big bad wolf! My sparkly eyes saw it! Let's vote for him now! Da da da\r
1,talk,9,1,2,Sakura’s “George is a wolf” came out too quick — feels forced.  @Minako  you said you checked me and found me human: what exact role are you claiming and which night did you check? Give specifics so we can decide how to vote. I’\r
1,talk,10,2,1,Let's take a moment and think this over. Sakura's claim seems questionable. Could she be Possessed trying to deflect? Trust Minako's divination.\r
1,talk,11,2,5,I am the Seer checked Shion on night 0 and found them human. Let's proceed carefully.\r
1,talk,12,2,4,...\r
1,talk,13,2,3,Minako is the Possessed! She's lying to protect George! Let's vote George today! Da da da\r
1,talk,14,2,2,You said you checked me and found me human —  @Minako   what role are you claiming and which night did you check? Sakura's quick "George is a wolf" looks rushed; if anyone has real results  speak now. I'm wait\r
1,talk,15,3,1,I trust Minako's role claim more. Minako said Shion is human and Sakura was quick to accuse. Let's pause and reflect on this.  @Midori  Hey Midori! What is your opinion on Minako and Sakura claiming Seer? Who do you think is more trustworthy now?\r
1,talk,16,3,5,I am claiming Seer and checked Shion as human on night 0. Let's hear Midori's thoughts.\r
