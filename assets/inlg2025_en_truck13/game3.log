1,talk,32,2,6, @Minato  your name came up in Yumi’s result. Before we vote can you claim your role directly? Silence is risky here.

3,talk,8,0,6, @Ryuji  you’re too silent this round. Wolves hide by avoiding direct talk. Speak up or I’ll vote for you.
3,talk,9,1,7,I guess silence can be quite suspicious. Ryuji-kun. Maybe you should speak up. What do you think of Victoria-san or Benjamin-san?
3,talk,10,1,8,Silence helps the wolves. I’ll vote  @Ryuji  today unless someone CO’s with solid results or arguments.
3,talk,11,1,10, @Servas  your aggressive push to vote Ryuji is illogical. It suggests a desire for an easy target.
3,talk,12,1,5,Mr. Ryuji's silence seems suspicious you see. But let's be open-minded. If I may. Ms. Victoria's deflections could hide her allies. Ms. Asuka have yo
3,talk,13,1,2,I'm really scared...  @Benjamin  you pushed to lynch Yumi and now she's gone — that makes you look suspicious. Why did you push so hard? If you can't explain I'll vote for you. Anyone agre
3,talk,14,1,13, @Ryuji  you’ve been really quiet—I’ll vote for you unless you share your thoughts now! Why are you holding back?
3,talk,15,1,11,...
3,talk,16,1,9, @Asuka  please reveal your divination (who you checked and the result). Yumi is dead and Shizue was attacked — we need info. If you won’t  I’ll push to lynch Rin.
3,talk,17,1,6, @Victoria  your defense of quiet players seems risky. Why not demand direct answers from Ryuji and others now?
3,talk,18,2,7,I guess... Benjamin-san seems too quick. Accusing someone hastily feels off. Maybe... we should think more before blaming Rin?
3,talk,19,2,8, @Victoria  your defense of Ryuji feels forced. Why protect someone who won’t speak? Explain your reasoning now.
3,talk,20,2,10,Our voting policy must maximize data. Executing a silent agent is strategically worthless.
3,talk,21,2,5,Mr. Ryuji remains silent adding tension you see. But equally curious are Mr. Benjamin's swift changes. Let's heed Asuka's divination.
3,talk,22,2,2,I'm really scared…  @Benjamin  you pushed to lynch Yumi and now she died — that's super suspicious. Please explain now or I'll vote you. Anyone with me? Over
3,talk,23,2,13,I’m worried everyone only focuses on Ryuji—if he’s a villager the wolf is coasting by. Can we look wider today?
3,talk,24,2,11,...
3,talk,25,2,9, @Asuka  please reveal your divination (who you checked and the result). Yumi's gone and Shizue was attacked — we need that info now. If you won't  I'll vote to ly
3,talk,26,2,6, @Victoria  why defend Ryuji’s silence? That risks letting wolves hide. We need direct answers from everyone now.
3,talk,27,3,7,I guess Ryuji-kun's silence is stressing. Maybe... he's hiding something? We have nothing!  @Jonathan . Shizue-san's attack. Thoughts?
3,talk,28,3,8,@Ryuji your silence endangers us all. I am voting for you. If we are wrong I will scrutinize  @Victoria  next.
3,talk,29,3,10,Consider the opponent's strategy. An easy execution benefits them. Servas's proposal aligns with this.
3,talk,30,3,5,We may have overlooked a wolf among active voices. Asuka claimed seer. Let's await her intel or deduction. Mr. Servas. Your focus on Mr. Ryuji seems pe
3,talk,31,3,2,I'm really scared and I'm voting  @Benjamin . He pushed to lynch Yumi and now she's dead—too suspicious. Tell me why we shouldn't lynch him. Hurry  please. Over
3,talk,32,3,13,I’ll vote Ryuji—too silent. But if he’s not wolf  let’s press Victoria and Asuka for answers tomorrow.
3,talk,33,3,11,...
3,talk,34,3,9, @Asuka  please reveal your divination (who you checked and result) now — Yumi's dead and we need direction. If you won't  I'll vote for Rin. Others  any concrete
3,talk,35,3,6,We can’t ignore Ryuji’s silence—he’s my vote. If he’s not wolf next target is Victoria or anyone avoiding direct answers.

4,talk,0,0,2,Oh no—Ryuji's gone... I'm really scared.  @Asuka  you've been awfully quiet lately; please tell us your read or role. Benjamin  do you have a lead? We need someone to suggest a vote. Over
4,talk,1,0,7,I guess... lots of seers cloud things. Maybe we should watch Kato-san and Yamada-san closely. Details seem crucial now.
4,talk,2,0,8, @Asuka  your silence is troubling. If you have a role or result to share now is the time. Hiding helps only the wolves.
4,talk,3,0,10,The Bodyguard was successful. This is new data.  @Asuka  your divination result is now critical.
4,talk,4,0,13, @Victoria  you said Bodyguard succeeded last night—what’s your evidence? Please clarify for everyone right now.
4,talk,5,0,6, @Victoria  claiming Bodyguard now feels off. Who did you actually protect last night? We need full details right now.
4,talk,6,0,5,If I may Mr. Ryuji's silence led to his vote out. Perhaps you see the talkative ones like Ms. Sakura or Ms. Asuka deserve focus now.
4,talk,7,0,9,Morning. Ryuji’s gone — we need concrete info.  @Rin  you’ve been very quiet; what are your reads and who will you vote for? Anyone with seer info please reveal now — I won't risk another random lynch. Over
4,talk,8,1,2,So scary—Ryuji's gone.  @Asuka  you've been quiet since the start and that makes me really suspicious. Please tell us your role now or I'll vote you. Who's with me? Over
4,talk,9,1,7,I guess Benjamin's recaps are... worrying without confirmation. Maybe Sakura-san has a point.  @Asuka -chan Any insights on last night?
4,talk,10,1,8, @Victoria  If you claim Bodyguard who did you protect last night? We need your answer before choosing today’s vote target.
4,talk,11,1,10, @Sakura  The log states a successful guard. It is public data not a claim. Our focus remains on Asuka.
4,talk,12,1,13,Victoria keeps deflecting by using “public log” but never claims a role. That feels like wolf play to me.
4,talk,13,1,6, @Victoria  unless you state your real role today you’re my top wolf suspect evasion isn’t helping the village at all
4,talk,14,1,5,Ms. Victoria's defense of Mr. Ryuji suggests an alliance. Could this be suspicious? You often deflect. If I may isn't that evasive?
4,talk,15,1,9, @Asuka  If you're the seer  reveal who you checked and the result now. If not  give a concrete read — otherwise I'll vote Rin. Anyone with a role claim speak up. Ove
4,talk,16,2,2,I'm really scared.  @Asuka  you've been quiet and weird since the start — I think you're a wolf. I'll vote you. Who's with me? Over
4,talk,17,2,7,I guess maybe... focusing on Victoria-san might help. Her actions seem inconsistent. Perhaps addressing responsibility could be key.
4,talk,18,2,8, @Victoria  Your refusal to name a role or detail last night’s action makes you my top suspect. Clarify now.
4,talk,19,2,10, @Servas  Focusing on me is inefficient. Executing Asuka resolves the Seer question. That is the logical move.
4,talk,20,2,13, @Victoria  you keep dodging questions and never CO. That’s classic wolf play. I’m voting for you today.
4,talk,21,2,6, @Victoria  your constant refusal to answer helps only the wolves. If you won't CO now I'm voting you today.
4,talk,22,2,5,If I may I find Ms. Victoria's exclusive focus on executing rather wolf-like. She tends to evade much you see. Use caution today.
4,talk,23,2,9, @Asuka  If you're the seer  reveal who you checked and the result now. If not  give a concrete read — otherwise I'll vote for Rin. Time's short. Over
4,talk,24,3,2,I'm really scared— @Benjamin  you pushed to lynch Yumi and now villagers kept dying. Please explain why you did that  or I'll vote for you. Who's with me? Over
4,talk,25,3,7,Maybe Asuka-san's stance needs more scrutiny. I guess it's a bit complex.  @Sakura -san. What do you think?
4,talk,26,3,8,After all this scrutiny Victoria’s evasions and lack of claim can’t be ignored. My vote is for  @Victoria .
4,talk,27,3,10,Consider the werewolf's objective. A vote on me is chaos. A vote on Asuka provides hard data.
4,talk,28,3,13,Victoria keeps dodging all direct questions. I’m voting Victoria. Please join me to protect the village from the wolves!
4,talk,29,3,6,@everyone I am voting Victoria. Dodging CO and twisting the log all day feels like a wolf move. Let’s unite on this.
