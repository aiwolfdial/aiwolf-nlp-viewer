0,whisper,0,0,3,Hello. I am Shizue. My role is werewolf. Have a good game.
0,whisper,1,0,1,At the risk of stating the obvious we should focus on Asuka or Benjamin tonight. They might be special roles. Any thoughts?
0,whisper,2,0,2,Misaki looked at Asuka and Benjamin thoughtfully. If it's alright Ms. Asuka seems protective. Mr. Benjamin has a bold aura... perhaps a seer?
0,whisper,3,1,3,Over
0,whisper,4,1,1,Well at the risk of stating the obvious I suspect Asuka is our bodyguard. If I may be so bold? Benjamin strikes me as the seer. Caution is wise.
0,whisper,5,1,2,Mr. Benjamin might be a key target tonight. If it's alright perhaps Asuka won't protect him. A calculated move I think.
0,whisper,6,2,1,I must say I concur with Misaki's insight. If Benjamin is indeed the seer removing him might just serve us quite well.
0,whisper,7,2,2,I agree. Mr. Benjamin is a key target. If it's alright with Ms. Asuka likely as bodyguard our advantage grows by removing threats.
0,whisper,8,3,1,Benjamin seems a strategic target. With Asuka possibly focused elsewhere the path might just open up. At the risk of stating the obvious! @Shizue At the risk of stating the obvious. If questioned. We must maintain our cover as villagers. I am but a humble villager myself.
0,whisper,9,3,2,I'll play a careful villager if it's alright. Discussing non-seer actions benefits us during voting perhaps just short-term.

1,talk,2,0,3,I will vote Benjamin.
1,talk,3,0,2,Ms. Jonathan or Ms. Victoria. Perhaps focusing on them might reveal their true nature. If it's alright we should choose one.

1,talk,5,0,1,At the risk of stating the obvious divining those who seem unsure could guide voting. If I may be so bold it prevents missteps.
1,talk,6,0,9, @Asuka  your quietness draws suspicion—what’s holding you back? Wolves often hesitate to speak up early.

1,talk,13,1,4,Jonathan's conclusion is erroneous. Takumi's assessment aligns with reality. Analyze from this premise.

1,talk,41,3,3,I will vote Asuka.
1,talk,42,3,2,Mr. Takumi. You claim innocence. Yet align with wolves' sneaky paths. Offering fake certainty is risky. Let's clarify today. @Takumi Why would you claim Seer Mr. or Ms. [name]? Wolves tend to fake roles. Do you fear being exposed perhaps? Please clarify.
1,talk,43,3,5,I’m voting Asuka—the outcome will show if Takumi or Jonathan is truthful and expose the wolves hiding among us.
1,talk,44,3,1,Voting for Takumi seems the safer move. I must say his late claim challenges Jonathan who dared to share first. Trust his timing? @Jonathan If I may be so bold Takumi's wolf claim on Asuka raises a question: why wait until danger looms to reveal? Perhaps stay wary?

1,whisper,1,0,2,Mr. Jonathan claims that Ms. Asuka is a werewolf. Perhaps he's possessed or just testing reactions. If it's alright let’s be wise. @Shunichi Mr. Jonathan's claim feels a bit questionable. Perhaps we should be a bit careful in trusting it too quickly. What do you think?

1,whisper,7,2,2,If it's alright. I feel targeting Mr. Benjamin is wise. Servas feels unpredictable too. Perhaps we should consider options tonight. @Shunichi Mr. Takumi favoring Asuka. That might mean he's not a seer. If it's alright. Let's be cautious around him. What do you think?
1,whisper,8,3,1,If I may be so bold. Strategy-wise Servas introduces a delightful unpredictability. A potential key target quite soon wouldn't you agree? @Misaki Takumi's claim stands on firm ground. If I may be so bold Servas should be observed closely. Let's focus on logical strategies.

3,talk,0,0,8,I will vote Misaki.
3,talk,1,0,5, @George  you keep splitting votes for no reason that helps wolves more than villagers explain yourself!
3,talk,2,0,4,Shion's elimination suggests they were a human asset.  @George  your baseless vote repeats yesterday's error.
3,talk,3,0,2,If it's alright our goal is to win. Splitting votes without clarity only aids the werewolves. Let's focus on consensus and rationality.
3,talk,4,0,9, @George  your votes keep splintering the town with no logic why should we trust you at this stage in the game?
3,talk,5,0,12, @George  your votes keep splitting us apart with little reason explain yourself or you’re my top wolf suspect today.
3,talk,6,0,13,Oh no—Takumi and Shion are gone. Any role claims or night info?  @Benjamin  did you divine anyone last night? I’m still suspicious of Misaki for staying vague earlier; without better leads I’ll vote them. Quick reads  please.
3,talk,7,0,1,Skip
3,talk,8,0,3,I will vote Benjamin.
3,talk,9,1,8,I will vote Misaki.
3,talk,10,1,5,Both vote outd were Human—wolves must be hiding among vote splitters like George or Shizue we need to target them!
3,talk,11,1,4, @George  your illogical vote for Misaki is a tactical diversion. You are the current prime suspect.
3,talk,12,1,2,Mr. Midori. If it's alright. George's vote divides us. If I may say. It's risky. Perhaps focus on those like him. Thoughts?
3,talk,13,1,9, @George  your votes never match the evidence you split us each time—why keep avoiding the main suspects?
3,talk,14,1,12, @George  your vote splits only help the wolves. Tell us clearly—who do you trust and who do you want out today?
3,talk,15,1,13,Oh no—Takumi and Shion gone.  @Benjamin  did you divine anyone last night? If not  can any remaining roles (doctor/seer) speak up? I’m noticing Servas has been pretty quiet—anyone else have a

3,talk,17,1,3,I will vote Benjamin.
3,talk,18,2,8,I will vote Misaki.
3,talk,19,2,5,Both vote outd were Human so wolves dodged suspicion.  @George  your votes always split the town. I’m focusing on you.
3,talk,20,2,4,Let us correct the trajectory of our logic. Vote George. His persistent vote-splitting is sabotage.
3,talk,21,2,2,Mr. George's choices don't align with our goals. It seems strange. And Ms. Shizue's support for Mr. Benjamin is puzzling too.
3,talk,22,2,9, @George  logic-free vote splitting keeps wolves safe. Who is your wolf pick and what’s your evidence this time?
3,talk,23,2,12, @George  your votes keep dividing us. Without solid logic you look like a wolf trying to hide. Can you explain your choices?
3,talk,24,2,13,Oh no—Takumi and Shion gone.  @Servas   are you the seer? If so please share any divination. I'm still uneasy about Misaki's vagueness earlier; any other quick reads or role claims? Over
3,talk,25,2,1,Skip
3,talk,26,2,3,I will vote Benjamin.
3,talk,27,3,8,I will vote Misaki.
3,talk,28,3,5,I will vote George. Repeated baseless voting only helps wolves. This is our last chance to unite as a town.
3,talk,29,3,4, @Shizue  your vote on Benjamin is as illogical as George's. This is coordinated disruption.
3,talk,30,3,2,Rin's quick blame is suspicious. Perhaps they redirect us? If wrong. Disaster. Is Rin misleading us? Let's reconsider. @George It's Rin. I sense their avoidance of true divination. Does that not concern you? Are they as trustworthy as they seem? We should reconsider.
3,talk,31,3,9,I’m voting  @George .
3,talk,32,3,12,My vote goes to  @George . His voting just sows confusion. Villagers must unite now—split votes only help the wolves win.
3,talk,33,3,13, @Servas  please share your divination result if you’re the seer. If no clear info soon I’ll likely vote Misaki for staying vague earlier. Any other reads? Over
3,talk,34,3,1,At the risk of stating the obvious Ms. Asuka's hasty finger-pointing could lead us astray. Trusting misinformation is a risky path.

3,whisper,0,0,2,Mr. Takumi. Rin suspects you aren't our ally. Perhaps we should vote wisely and focus our strategies elsewhere if it's alright. @Shunichi Mr. Jonathan feels allied. Perhaps we should be careful about any attacks. He may aid us if it's alright don't you think?
3,whisper,1,0,3,I will attack Midori.
3,whisper,2,0,1,At the risk of stating the obvious Jonathan's claim regarding Asuka as Werewolf might just be a clever ruse. If I may be so bold perhaps we should not tar
3,whisper,3,1,2,If it's alright. Mr. Takumi might be a seer. He claims Ms. Midori is Human. Perhaps target. Watch for bodyguard protection. @Shunichi Takumi mentioned his divination result on Ms. Midori as Human. If it's alright let's consider potential threats. Caution is key.
3,whisper,4,1,3,Over
3,whisper,5,1,1,At the risk of stating the obvious. Takumi might be our seer. He divined both Asuka and Midori as Human. Do tread lightly. @Misaki Takumi and Rin pose potential threats. At the risk of stating the obvious they could be seers. Yet bodyguard protection is vital.
3,whisper,6,2,2,If it's alright. Ms. Rin feels important. Perhaps medium or bodyguard. Let's stay cautious and observe. @Shunichi If it's alright. Our focus might need some adjustment. Midori and Rin seem crucial. Perhaps they hold protective roles? Let's evaluate wisely.
3,whisper,7,2,1,At the risk of stating the obvious. Takumi might be our seer. He divined both Asuka and Midori as Human. Do tread lightly. @Misaki Takumi and Rin pose potential threats. At the risk of stating the obvious they could be seers. Yet bodyguard protection is vital.
3,whisper,8,3,2,If it's alright targeting Midori seems wise. She might be protected or perhaps has a special role. Let's take this chance. @Shunichi If it's alright let's maintain our cover as villagers. Perhaps we should seize the right timing. This way we keep pressure off us.
3,whisper,9,3,1,At the risk of stating the obvious. Takumi might be our seer. He divined both Asuka and Midori as Human. Do tread lightly. @Misaki Takumi and Rin pose potential threats. At the risk of stating the obvious they could be seers. Yet bodyguard protection is vital.

4,talk,2,0,2,If it's alright we should watch the quiet ones. Mr. Servas seems quiet. Silence might conceal a wolf don't you think?
4,talk,3,0,4,Benjamin's elimination by attack confirms his value. Re-evaluate who he found suspicious.
4,talk,4,0,12, @Shizue  you always avoid main targets. Why shouldn’t we see that as a wolf move and suspect you most now?
4,talk,5,0,13,Oh no — George and Benjamin are gone. Any night info?  @Servas  did you divinate anyone? I'm suspicious of Shunichi for staying quiet; Shizue seems low-conflict and likely town. Thoughts? Over
4,talk,6,0,5, everyone vote outd so far was human. Wolves slipped by.  @Shizue ’s voting looks worst—I’ll vote Shizue.

4,talk,9,1,2, @Servas . If it's alright. I wonder about Ms. Shizue's voting. Curious indeed. Is it strategy or just avoiding main votes?
4,talk,10,1,4,Since Rin is our logical axiom then Shizue who opposes her is a system error to be removed.
4,talk,11,1,12, @Misaki  you question everyone else but take no stance. Today’s too tight for ‘curious’—who do you *actually* suspect?
4,talk,12,1,13,Any night info?  @Servas  please share your divination if you have one. I'm still wary of Misaki — they've been vague and dodged specifics. If no clear seer info  I'm inclined to v
4,talk,13,1,5,Medium confirms all vote out so far were humans. Shizue’s split votes help wolves. Let’s unite and vote Shizue out now!
4,talk,14,2,3,I will vote Rin.

4,talk,16,2,2,Mr. Servas suggests action now. Ms. Shizue's constant divergent voting concerns me. It hinders our focus. Let's resolve this.
4,talk,17,2,4,The margin for error is now zero. Divergent theories will lead to our collective failure.
4,talk,18,2,12, @Shizue  your constant vote splitting risks all. Today I’m voting you unless you give one clear wolf suspect and reason.
4,talk,19,2,13,Any night info?  @Servas  please share your divination now — we need a concrete lead. I'm still inclined to vote Misaki for being vague and evasive. Anyone planning to vote diff
4,talk,20,2,5,We’ve only vote outd villagers—if we don’t stop  @Shizue ’s sabotage now the wolves will win tonight.
4,talk,21,3,3,I will vote Rin.
4,talk,22,3,1,At the risk of stating the obvious. Rin's penchant for medium focus sidetracks us. Anyone else spot their classic wolf-like misdirection?
4,talk,23,3,2,If it's alright Mr. or Ms. If Rin is truly innocent why wasn't she the focus of divination? Her votes help wolves consistently. Let's not be tricked! @Rin Mr. or Ms. Wolf. Why avoid main targets I wonder. Your votes split. Benefit wolves. Is it deliberate or just coincidence?

4,talk,25,3,12,Today I’m voting Shizue—her constant vote splitting only helps wolves. Town must unite or we lose tonight.
