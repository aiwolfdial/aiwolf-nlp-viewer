1,talk,2,0,11,Midori my dear your silence is puzzling. I understand we need clearer contributions to decide well. Is anyone else off today?
1,talk,3,0,13, @Victoria  could you share your divination result? I think it helps us decide how to move forward today.
1,talk,4,0,1,No lynch from me—claims need evidence.  @Victoria  show your divination result or retract. I'm uneasy about Shion's brusque tone; he shut down discussion. Over
1,talk,5,0,4,I am a seer. I divined Yumi and Yumi was a werewolf.
1,talk,6,0,6, @Yumi  Victoria claims you’re a werewolf. Care to defend yourself or explain why we shouldn’t trust her CO?
1,talk,7,0,9, @Yumi  Victoria has made her claim. The stage is yours now. Don't waste our time.
1,talk,8,0,12,Whaaat?! Yumi's not a wolf! Victoria's telling a super mean fib! She's the suspicious one
1,talk,9,0,10,You know my dear. Victoria's claim is quite bold isn't it so? Whether Yumi is truly a werewolf remains a matter of further insight.
1,talk,10,0,7,Victoria's assertion regarding Yumi is indeed bold. One must deliberate whether it arises from genuine conviction or desperation.
1,talk,11,0,3,Jonathan's gone—that's rough. Victoria claimed seer but gave no result; that's suspicious.  @Victoria  reveal your divination result now or withdraw your claim. I still don't want a rash lynch until we have clearer info. Over
1,talk,12,0,8,I will vote Yumi.
1,talk,13,1,5, @Jonathan  you're quick to trust Victoria. What makes you so sure Yumi's the wolf? Can you explain your reasoning?

1,talk,15,1,11,Victoria might reveal threats so let's focus her on Minato or Shizue tonight.  @Minato  Who should the seer divine? Your instincts can help.
1,talk,16,1,13, @Jonathan  don't you think trusting Victoria right away is risky? I feel we need more discussion before deciding.
1,talk,17,1,1,Let's skip lynch for now.  @Victoria  please show your divination result or explain why you claimed seer—no proof  no trust. I'll watch behavior and votes. Over
1,talk,18,1,4,I will vote Shion.
1,talk,19,1,6, @Jonathan  why jump on Yumi so fast? Victoria might be faking. We need more than just a CO to decide today.

1,talk,21,1,12,Victoria is being a meanie! Why vote for Shion? Let's ignore her and vote for someone quiet today
1,talk,22,1,10,You know my dear. Yumi defending herself so loudly makes me ponder. Perhaps we should simply observe her today isn't that so?  @Midori . You've been a bit quiet precious. What do you think of Victoria's claim? Do you trust it or not?

1,talk,28,2,11, @Jonathan  Voting for me? That's unexpected. I am indeed a genuine villager. I suggest discussing a safe vote my dear.
1,talk,29,2,13, @Victoria  you called Yumi a wolf but voted Shion instead. Can you explain why you didn't vote your own suspect first?

1,talk,31,2,4,I will vote Shion.
1,talk,32,2,6, @Victoria  your voting doesn’t match your divination. Unless you explain I’ll consider you the top wolf candidate.
1,talk,33,2,9,Enough games. Victoria played her hand and lost. My vote is on Victoria.
1,talk,34,2,12,Victoria is super weird! Let's ignore her and vote for quiet Midori today
1,talk,35,2,10,You know my dear Victoria's decision seems rather peculiar. Observing Midori in silence today might reveal more truth isn't that so?
1,talk,36,2,7,Midori remains silent. Suspicion grows as Victoria's actions only lead to an increase in uncertainty. Shion’s vote may uncover the truth.
1,talk,37,2,3,Victoria claimed seer but hasn't given proof.  @Midori  if you're the real seer  reveal your result now; if not  say so. I still oppose rushing a lynch—let's get claims and results first. Over

2,talk,15,1,7,Midori. Your silence is causing disorder. Speaking up would be wise. Jonathan. Your frequent target changes are raising questions.

2,talk,26,2,7,Midori's silence remains an enigma. Shunichi if you are indeed the seer you could dispel considerable doubt with your divination.

2,talk,33,3,5,My mind’s made up. Midori’s silence has lost us time and info. I’m voting  @Midori  today—no more chances.

2,talk,37,3,7,Midori. Your ongoing silence hinders progress and raises suspicion. Jonathan's voting seems erratic. Can we hear your thoughts?

3,talk,0,0,8,I will vote Shion.
3,talk,1,0,11,I'm suspicious of Jonathan. His voting behavior seems odd. I understand your concerns. Let me consider that more thoroughly.
3,talk,2,0,12,Waaah Shunichi went kaboom! Only 9 people left! Jonathan's weird voting is super duper suspicious
3,talk,3,0,10,You know my dear. Choosing whom to divine is like tending a garden. Focus on divisive figures to reveal truths isn't that so?
3,talk,4,0,7,I believe we should scrutinize who favored Victoria like Jonathan. His voting pattern appears notably inconsistent.
3,talk,5,0,13, @Jonathan  your vote yesterday confused me—can you explain your choice? It felt out of sync with the village.
3,talk,6,0,3,Midori's dead and we lost our seer—dangerous. I'm leaning to suspect  @Jonathan  — his earlier behavior doesn't sit right. Jonathan  explain your reads or I'll consider voting you. Over
3,talk,7,0,5, @Jonathan  you keep dodging every question. If you’re not a wolf give us one clear reason for your vote now.
3,talk,8,0,9,Everyone finally noticed Jonathan. He's just repeating a dead liar's words. End this farce.
3,talk,9,1,8,I will vote Shion.
3,talk,10,1,11,Jonathan's contradictions make me curious. Let's reconsider his statements and decide. Minato. I understand your concerns about his votes.
3,talk,11,1,12,See! Everyone thinks Jonathan is weird! He just keeps voting for Shion. He is the most suspicious one
3,talk,12,1,10,You know my dear. Jonathan's voting seems quite curious to me. We must act with logic. Who agrees Shion's defense needs scrutiny?  @Jonathan  Darling could you share your reason for always choosing Shion? Your choices seem erratic now. What has changed?
3,talk,13,1,7, @Jonathan  You seem to be under quite a bit of pressure today. Can you elucidate your rationale behind persistently voting for Shion?
3,talk,14,1,13,Jonathan’s repeated Shion votes look odd but I want a clear answer before I decide. Who actually trusts his logic?
3,talk,15,1,3,I vote  @Jonathan . He hasn't explained himself and we can't afford silence—who's with me? Over
3,talk,16,1,5,Jonathan keeps dodging real answers about his votes. Isn't this exactly how a wolf hides? Who still trusts him right now?
3,talk,17,1,9,The discussion's over. Jonathan's behavior is inexcusable. Let's get on with the vote.
3,talk,18,2,8,I will vote Shion.
3,talk,19,2,11,I understand the concern my dear. Jonathan's vote for Shion lacks clarity. Let's discuss his motives with careful consideration.
3,talk,20,2,12,What if the wolves told Jonathan to vote weirdly to confuse us? Let's kaboom him
3,talk,21,2,10,You know my dear. It might be wise to gather our thoughts on Mr. Jonathan's peculiar votes. Or should we ponder Miss Yumi or Mizuki isn't that so?
3,talk,22,2,7,Senator Blakeley I've been contemplating our next divination. We should focus on those causing confusion like Jonathan.
3,talk,23,2,13,Jonathan’s stance makes no sense logically—does anyone feel comfortable trusting his voting strategy now?
3,talk,24,2,3,I keep my vote on  @Jonathan —he's given no useful reads and we can't waste time. Anyone defending him? Over
3,talk,25,2,5,Jonathan keeps dodging real questions and just repeats Shion. That’s a classic wolf move.
3,talk,26,2,9,Pondering anyone else is a gift to the wolves. Their only chance is our hesitation. Let's end this.
3,talk,27,3,8,I will vote Mizuki.
3,talk,28,3,11,I understand Ryuji raises suspicion. His contradictions harm trust. Could his actions steer us toward ruin? Let us vote wisely. @Misaki I've been observing Jonathan. Let me consider Ryuji's odd behaviors. I understand your concern over his potential threat.
3,talk,29,3,12,Misaki is right! Jonathan is too bouncy and confusing! My vote is on him too! Lets blast him away
3,talk,30,3,10,You know my dear. When pondering divinations perhaps focus on those who cause disruption.  @Misaki  Misaki dear. Jonathan's voting is perplexing isn't that so?
3,talk,31,3,7,Jonathan's voting is indeed inconsistent as I mentioned to Mizuki. Before we act quickly let's gather more insights.  @Mizuki  Your frequent mentions of Jonathan are justified. His voting pattern is erratic but what leads you to suspect me? Let's discuss your findings.
3,talk,32,3,13,I still don't see sense in Jonathan's votes so I’m voting him out. If he's not a wolf let's reconsider Ryuji tomorrow.
3,talk,33,3,3,I keep my vote on  @Jonathan . We don't have solid claims left—speak up with evidence or I'm for lynching him now. Over
3,talk,34,3,5,I’m voting  @Jonathan —too many dodges and weird votes. Anyone switching last second needs a solid reason!

3,whisper,0,0,13,Let’s all vote Jonathan today. For bite out tonight I prefer Ryuji unless a Seer or Medium COs. Thoughts?
3,whisper,1,0,11,I understand. Let me consider Victoria's divination statement. If we target Ryuji tonight she might indeed be protected tonight. @Yumi Stay cautious. If Victoria openly divined me she might be under bodyguard protection. Let us weigh our options very wisely.
3,whisper,2,0,12,Yippee our plan worked again! Let's go with Minato's idea and make Ryuji go kaboom tonight! Tomorrow let's all blame Misaki for being too bossy
3,whisper,3,1,13,Let’s keep pushing for Jonathan’s vote out today. If no one claims power role tonight let’s bite Ryuji.
3,whisper,4,1,11,Let me consider that my dear. I understand Minato suggested Ryuji. We should reflect on Misaki's role and how she fits tonight's plan. @Yumi Let me consider that. Misaki's assertive stance might indicate a special role. I understand the importance of leading without suspicion.
3,whisper,5,1,12,Okay! Let's kaboom Ryuji tonight like Minato said! Tomorrow we blame Misaki for being too bossy! We're so close to winning yay
3,whisper,6,2,13,Let’s all vote Jonathan today. Tonight we should bite Ryuji unless a CO appears. After that Misaki is a good mislynch target.
3,whisper,7,2,11,I understand. Misaki could be a significant player. Her assertiveness suggests her potential influence and importance my dear. @Yumi I understand. Let me consider that. Misaki's strong stance indicates she plays a significant role. Focusing on her could be strategic.
3,whisper,8,2,12,Okay! Let's make Ryuji go kaboom tonight! Tomorrow we get bossy Misaki! We're so close to winning yay
3,whisper,9,3,13,Let’s vote Jonathan today and bite Ryuji tonight if no new CO. If CO appears change bite to Misaki or Shion.
3,whisper,10,3,11,I understand my dear. Ryuji is a wise choice. His behavior shows he plays a crucial role and remains unsuspected by many. @Yumi It's exciting to see our plan in motion! If Misaki pins suspicions on me could you also defend me subtly?
3,whisper,11,3,12,Yay another one blasted! Let's stick to the plan! Ryuji goes kaboom tonight then tomorrow we all blame Misaki! We're almost there

4,talk,0,0,10,You know my dear I find Ryuji's contradictions puzzling. Mr. Ryuji could you kindly clarify what has spurred your recent doubts?
4,talk,1,0,11,Ryuji's defense lacks clarity. I understand the need for unity in targeting wolves. Let's carefully consider his voting patterns.
4,talk,2,0,7,With Victoria's divination failing and Jonathan's erratic voting I'm questioning their intentions. Let's maintain our focus.  @Shizue  I've doubted Victoria's claim and Jonathan's votes but lack tangible evidence for my suspicions. Let's evaluate our mutual trust.
4,talk,3,0,12,Waaah Misaki got kaboomed! The wolves must have been scared of her! Ryuji is being weird and suspicious
4,talk,4,0,9,Misaki got hit because she was a threat. That means yesterday's vote was correct. So who benefits from this chaos?
4,talk,5,0,5, @Ryuji  you keep dodging real suspects. Who exactly is your top wolf pick and why? Please be clear this time.
4,talk,6,0,13,Honestly Ryuji keeps changing positions after each vote I feel like he’s hedging Shouldn’t we consider him more today?
4,talk,7,1,10,You know my dear. Misaki's elimination is quite curious. Who benefits from silencing someone so active? Let's ponder isn't that so?
4,talk,8,1,11,Misaki’s exit implies the wolves found her threatening. Ryuji’s changing views worry me. Can you clarify your suspicions now and why?
4,talk,9,1,7,Victoria's deceit as a seer raises concerns. Jonathan's voting now appears suspicious. Shall we scrutinize his strong supporters?
4,talk,10,1,12,Mizuki is right! Ryuji's words are all weird and confusing! I think we should blast him
4,talk,11,1,9,The wolves lost a man so they're framing Ryuji. He's been consistent. I'm defending him.
4,talk,12,1,5, @Ryuji  you only started shifting blame after votes piled up. Do you have any concrete wolf suspects right now?
4,talk,13,1,13,Ryuji has switched his stance a lot this game. I think he’s the riskiest to keep alive right now.
4,talk,14,2,10,You know my dear. Ryuji's emotions guide him. Isn't it unsettling when votes stack? Shouldn't we thoughtfully decide together?  @Ryuji  What are your thoughts on Mizuki's insights about unity and patterns? It may illuminate intentions mightn't it?
4,talk,15,2,11,Ryuji's erratic changes and limited evidence make him risky. I understand your hesitation. Others seem more consistent.
4,talk,16,2,7,Misaki's exit suggests wolf threats. Exercise caution about Minato's claimed seer role. Mizuki? I find voting patterns quite perplexing.
4,talk,17,2,12, @Shion  It's not a frame! Ryuji is just being confusing all by himself! Let's blast him
4,talk,18,2,9,We're wasting time going in circles on Ryuji. This is exactly the chaos the wolves want.
4,talk,19,2,5, @Shion  you keep defending Ryuji but what makes you trust him so much? Are you seeing something we don’t?
4,talk,20,2,13,Ryuji keeps shifting his stance whenever suspicion grows. That’s classic wolf behavior this late. I say vote him out.
4,talk,21,3,10,You know my dear. Jonathan's votes were quite odd weren't they? Let's keep an eye on Ryuji. Voting Jonathan felt pressured. Shall we aim for clarity is
4,talk,22,3,11,Shizue's constant deflection seems too calculated to trust. Let me consider this. Should we not examine those sowing doubt? @Ryuji I understand. Let's consider Shizue's deflections. By aligning on their suspicions true intentions may surface. What's your take?
4,talk,23,3,7,Shion's insights seem truthful. Our priority should be the enigmatic Minato. Their seer claim lacks evidence. We should observe more.
4,talk,24,3,12,I still think Ryuji is the most suspicious! His words are like bumpy roads! Let's blast him for sure
4,talk,25,3,9,Enough with Ryuji. The real threat is the one pulling the strings. My vote is on Shizue.
4,talk,26,3,5,Ryuji’s accusations zigzag all day I’m voting Ryuji Let’s focus and not split our votes tonight everyone
4,talk,27,3,13,Ryuji’s changes have made him a top suspect but Shion’s repeated defense gives me pause For now I’ll vote Ryuji—too many red
