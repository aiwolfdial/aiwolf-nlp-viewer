1,talk,18,1,1,Minato only CO’d Seer after me and instantly called me a wolf—that timing is suspicious and feels forced.
1,talk,19,1,13,Um...everyone. Let's think about this. Ryuji made his claim before me. But he um...falsely attacked me right after I spoke.
1,talk,20,1,4,The seer claims are too noisy. It's better to vote a gray player today and observe more.
1,talk,21,1,10,I will vote Ryuji.

1,talk,27,2,8,I will vote Ryuji.
1,talk,28,2,6,I believe Minato’s Seer claim feels genuine so I’ll vote Ryuji today. If I’m wrong I’ll listen to new info tomorrow.
1,talk,29,2,5, @George  @Servas your votes on Ryuji seem coordinated. Can you explain your reasons beyond just targeting the first CO?
1,talk,30,2,7,George's voting is all over the place! My adventurer's intuition says vote for him today!
1,talk,31,2,1, @Minato  only CO’d Seer after me and instantly called me wolf. That’s classic fake play. Villagers should not fall for this.
1,talk,32,2,13,Um...Mr. Ryuji might be...a werewolf or maybe possessed. I promise I am...the true Seer. Ms. Mio...you have any thoughts?
1,talk,33,2,4,A seer vote is what the wolves want. It is illogical. George's votes are a larger anomaly to study.

1,talk,38,2,11,Good morning dear heart. A double seer claim is tricky indeed. If Minato is our true seer we must protect him dear.  @George  Your votes seem inconsistent dear. Could you share why you targeted Ryuji despite uncertainties among the seer claims?
1,talk,39,3,9,Morning everyone — Yumi here. No role claim.  @Daisuke  you’ve been awfully quiet — can you share your thoughts or reads? I don’t want a Day 1 lynch  but if we have to pick someone  I’m leaning toward Daisuke. Ove
1,talk,40,3,8,I will vote Ryuji.
1,talk,41,3,6,I’ll vote Ryuji today since Minato’s claim seems more genuine.

3,talk,16,1,1, @Daisuke  Servas is confirmed wolf by my divine. Will you vote Servas now to secure our villager win?
3,talk,17,1,12,Dear good sir Servas. If I may say so. Your vote for Ryuji seems quite perplexing as he claims to be the true seer. Can you justify this action?
3,talk,18,2,6, @Servas  you kept avoiding questions and never share seer results. If you’re innocent defend yourself now before we vote.
3,talk,19,2,11,Skip
3,talk,20,2,7,Ryuji's our confirmed guide! So my vote's for Servas the wolf! Let's win this adventure everyone
3,talk,21,2,4,The point is simple. Mio's attack verified Ryuji. Our target today must be Servas.
3,talk,22,2,9,Good morning — Yumi here.  @Servas  please reveal your seer result now. If you divined Daisuke as wolf I’ll vote him today. Let’s not rush a lynch without confirmation. Over
3,talk,23,2,3,Oh no... Minato's gone and Mio was attacked! Seer please reveal who you checked. I want to vote  @Ryuji  — he seems suspicious to me. Anyone disagree? Over
3,talk,24,2,10,I will vote Ryuji.
3,talk,25,2,1,Servas is confirmed wolf by my divine. If villagers unite and vote Servas today we secure the win. Don’t split votes.
3,talk,26,2,12,If I may say so securing a Villager win seems within our grasp esteemed colleagues. Let's align our votes against Servas to ensure it.
3,talk,27,3,6,I’m voting Servas—her voting and silence just don’t add up. If she isn’t a wolf we should look at Sakura next.
3,talk,28,3,11,Skip
3,talk,29,3,7,Ryuji is confirmed! Let's vote the wolf Servas!  @Sakura  why are you defending him?! Suspicious
3,talk,30,3,4,Ryuji is our confirmed star. The trajectory is clear. My vote must be for his wolf result Servas.
3,talk,31,3,9,Good morning — Yumi here.  @Servas  please reveal your seer result now. If you divined Daisuke as werewolf I’ll vote him and push to lynch today. Don’t rush without confirmation. Over
3,talk,32,3,3,Seer please reveal who you checked. I’m leaning to vote  @Ryuji  — he’s feeling kinda off to me. Anyone think differently? Over
3,talk,33,3,10,I will vote Ryuji.
3,talk,34,3,1,I’m voting Servas as my divine result shows she’s a werewolf. Don’t give the wolves a chance. Please join me on Servas.
3,talk,35,3,12,Fellow villagers! With all due respect with Ryuji as our confirmed Seer. Servas the wolf must be today's focus. Mr. Takumi I see your enthusiasm! Let'

4,talk,0,0,1,@Everyone I divined Daisuke last night—he is human. The wolf has to be Sakura Yumi Benjamin or Takumi. Let’s focus there.
4,talk,1,0,3,Oh no... Servas was executed and Misaki was attacked! Seer please reveal.  @Benjamin  do you have any reads or info? I'm really scared—please speak up everyone. Over
4,talk,2,0,9,Morning — Yumi here.  @Daisuke  you’ve been quiet — can you share your read or claim now? If no one speaks up  I’m leaning to put votes on Ryuji today. Let’s not scramble last minute. Over
4,talk,3,0,12,Skip
4,talk,4,0,7,Ryuji cleared Daisuke! The wolves are Yumi Benjamin or Sakura! Let's get 'em! Go team
4,talk,5,0,11,Skip
4,talk,6,0,6, @Sakura  Minato said you’re a wolf and you’ve never responded clearly. Can you explain your side right now?
4,talk,7,1,1, @Yumi  you’re quick to doubt the Seer. Why should we trust you over Sakura or Benjamin? Defend your position clearly.
4,talk,8,1,3,Oh no... Servas and Misaki are gone. Seer please reveal who you checked. I want to vote  @Ryuji  — he’s feeling really suspicious to me. Any objections? Over
4,talk,9,1,9,I’m voting  @Daisuke  — he’s been quiet and looks suspect. If no one has a better target  let’s lynch him today. Over
4,talk,10,1,12,To put it bluntly Mr. Ryuji Daisuke's silence does indeed raise questions that warrant our attention if I may say so.
4,talk,11,1,7,Why attack our teammates? Sakura and Yumi ignore our seer's results! I'm voting for Sakura!
4,talk,12,1,11,Skip
4,talk,13,1,6, @Sakura  you keep avoiding Minato’s claim and never defend yourself—can you explain why you’re not the wolf?
4,talk,14,2,1, @Daisuke  @Takumi the cleared pool is solid—vote outside it and we risk losing. Let’s stick to logical suspects only.
4,talk,15,2,3,Oh no... I’m so scared. Seer please reveal who you checked! I want to vote  @Ryuji  — he’s acting really suspicious. Anyone defending him? Over
4,talk,16,2,9,I voted  @Daisuke . His silence is suspicious—if he doesn’t defend himself now I’ll stick with lynch. Anyone got a different read? Over
4,talk,17,2,12,If I may say so. Mr. Ryuji's record is unparalleled. Let's focus on Ms. Sakura or Ms. Yumi. Thoughts on red flags?
4,talk,18,2,7, @Sakura  why help the wolves by targeting our guide Ryuji?! You're my vote for sure today! Let's go
4,talk,19,2,11,Skip
4,talk,20,2,6, @Yumi  you focus on my silence but skip Sakura’s evasions. Why suspect me over someone who keeps dodging real answers?
4,talk,21,3,1,My vote is for Sakura. Her avoidance of direct answers looks like wolf behavior. Let’s not let this slip by today.
4,talk,22,3,3,Seer please reveal who you checked. I’m really scared—if no one can prove Ryuji is innocent I want to vote  @Ryuji . Anyone defending him? Over
4,talk,23,3,9,I voted  @Daisuke . You’ve been quiet—can you defend yourself or claim a role now? If not  I’ll stick with lynch. Any strong objections? Over
4,talk,24,3,12,If I may say so Mr. Ryuji Sakura's persistent elusiveness is rather... intriguing. Perhaps a united front is warranted here.
4,talk,25,3,7,Sakura and Yumi are both ignoring our guide! They have to be the last wolves! My vote is on Sakura
4,talk,26,3,11,Skip
4,talk,27,3,6,I’m voting Sakura. She keeps dodging real questions and never explains herself. I want us to stay united on this.

5,talk,0,0,6, @Yumi  You keep pushing me even though I was cleared by Seer Ryuji. Why do you ignore all game logic and results?
5,talk,1,0,9,Morning — Yumi here.  @Ryuji  you’ve been pretty quiet so far; what are your reads? I’m leaning toward voting you if you don’t have a good defense. Over
5,talk,2,0,1, Sakura is Human. That leaves only Yumi and Benjamin unchecked. I strongly suspect Yumi as the last wolf.
5,talk,3,0,12,Ms. Yumi. If I may say so. Your previous vote appears inconsistent. Why target Mr. Daisuke when Mr. Ryuji confirmed him as human?
5,talk,4,0,11,Skip
5,talk,5,1,6, @Yumi  you keep voting against people Ryuji already cleared as human.
5,talk,6,1,9,I’m voting  @Daisuke . You’ve been weirdly quiet and dodged questions — defend yourself now or I’ll stick with this. Over
5,talk,7,1,1, @Yumi  you keep ignoring Seer results and voting against confirmed villagers that’s classic wolf behavior at endgame.
5,talk,8,1,12,If I may say so it seems rather hazardous to dismiss Mr. Ryuji's assertions. Should we not perhaps focus on Ms. Yumi's divisiveness?
5,talk,9,1,11,Skip
5,talk,10,2,6, @Yumi  you keep ignoring Seer results and cleared humans why are you still pushing for my vote? That looks like wolf behavior.
5,talk,11,2,9,I’m not convinced — I won’t follow. Daisuke might just be quiet from pressure. I’m leaning  @Ryuji  instead; he’s been too silent for me. Anyone else? Over
5,talk,12,2,1, @Yumi  you are ignoring every seer result and cleared villager. That only benefits the werewolf. Why keep doing this?
5,talk,13,2,12,If I may say so. Let's concentrate on Ms. Yumi. Our divination results indicate consistency. Good villagers. Stay vigilant.  @Daisuke  Her persistent contrarian votes suggest evasion. What's your assessment based on Ryuji's reliable seer revelations?
5,talk,14,2,11,Skip
5,talk,15,3,6,I've made my decision—I'm voting  @Yumi . She ignores every Seer result and logic. If we want to win we need to target her now.
5,talk,16,3,9,I voted  @Ryuji . He’s been quiet and evasive — defend yourself now or I’ll stick with this. Over
5,talk,17,3,1, Shizue Daisuke and Sakura are human. Yumi keeps pushing against my results so I vote Yumi.
5,talk,18,3,12,If I may say so aligning with Mr. Ryuji's divination results is wise. Ms. Yumi's relentless defiance is to put it bluntly suspicious.
