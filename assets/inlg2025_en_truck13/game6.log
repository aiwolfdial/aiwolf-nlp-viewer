0,whisper,0,0,2,I suggest we kill  @Minako  tonight—quiet and likely villager. If you want someone else  say so quickly.
0,whisper,1,0,1,Hello. I am Servas. My role is werewolf. Have a good game.
0,whisper,2,0,3,I don't want to rush... Ryuji suggested  @Minako —I'm okay with that unless you prefer someone else. Servas claiming werewolf feels odd. Thoughts?
0,whisper,3,1,2,Let's stick with  @Minako  tonight. Servas's "werewolf" claim seems fake — probably trying to sow confusion. If anyone strongly objects  speak now. Over
0,whisper,4,1,1,Over
0,whisper,5,1,3,I'm okay with  @Minako  tonight. Servas  was your public "werewolf" claim serious? We should avoid drawing attention — pick someone quiet. Over
0,whisper,6,2,2,Agree — kill  @Minako  tonight. Let Servas's claim stand; it creates confusion. During day  avoid bold claims and keep our story simple. Over
0,whisper,7,2,3,I don't like this  but I agree to kill  @Minako  tonight. Let Servas's claim stand and keep things quiet in the day — I'll stay low and follow your lead. Over
0,whisper,8,3,2,Agreed — we kill  @Minako  tonight. Servas  keep pushing your claim and draw attention; Daisuke  stay quiet tomorrow. I’ll step up only if someone pushes too hard. No other claim
0,whisper,9,3,3,Okay. I’ll stay quiet tomorrow. Servas  keep pushing your claim and draw attention. Be careful of  @Benjamin —he might be the seer. If he probes us I’ll speak up briefly to deflect. Over

0,whisper,4,1,3,Okay... I’ll stay low tomorrow. Let Servas be loud; I’ll only make quiet comments to nudge suspicion toward  @Benjamin  if needed. If someone claims a role  ask for proof and sow doubt subtly. If Servas gets challenged  I’ll give a small backup. Over

1,talk,2,0,10,I believe it prudent to remain unobtrusive and observe interactions keenly. We are still discerning whom to place our trust in are we not?
1,talk,3,0,12,Before we all focus on Benjamin I want to hear from @George and  @Toshio . Where do your suspicions point right now?
1,talk,4,0,7,I am the Seer. My analysis targeted Benjamin. The result was HUMAN.
1,talk,5,0,2,Good morning. Minako’s death matters—keep accusations light. One-sentence reads and any role claims now.  @Benjamin  you were very calm yesterday—who do you distrust? I’ll stay low unless something concrete appears. Over
1,talk,6,0,3,I'm really sorry about Minako... I don't have much to say  but  @Benjamin  you seem awfully calm—what's your read? I'll mostly listen. Over
1,talk,7,0,4,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,8,0,11,A single Seer's report. This is a most critical data point. I will trust  @Toshio 's analysis.
1,talk,9,0,8,You know. Let me tell you. Keeping an eye on Mr. Ryuji and Mr. Benjamin seems wise. They appear unusually calm in this tense situation.
1,talk,10,0,13,...
1,talk,11,0,5,Focusing on cool-headed players like Ryuji or Benjamin is key. We need clarity on why they're so calm. I'm sure of it!
1,talk,12,0,9, @George  I don’t buy that “calm” is enough—Toshio’s Seer result matters. Who do you actually suspect now?
1,talk,13,1,1,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,14,1,6,If we trust a single Seer CO too quickly we could be falling for a bluff. Shouldn’t we press Toshio a bit more?
1,talk,15,1,10,Let us evaluate Toshio's claim thoughtfully. Tonight's divination should target less active or uncertain individuals. Mr. Minato. You cast a vote
1,talk,16,1,12, @Jonathan  you’ve got a few votes already—who do you suspect today and why? Want to hear your thoughts clearly.
1,talk,17,1,7,My data shows Benjamin is human. The vote today should target an unconfirmed subject.
1,talk,18,1,2,Minako’s death is worrying—quick one-line reads and any role claims.  @Benjamin  you were awfully calm yesterday—who do you distrust? I’ll stay low unless concrete evidence shows. Over
1,talk,19,1,3,I still don’t have much to say.  @Benjamin  you seem very calm—what’s your read so far? Let’s wait for role claims before voting. I’ll mostly listen. Over
1,talk,20,1,4,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,21,1,11,Toshio's analysis cleared me. The logical course is to eliminate an unconfirmed subject today.
1,talk,22,1,8,You know. It's crucial not to rush judgment on a single Seer's report. Mr. Jonathan. Who do you find suspicious and why? Let's evaluate carefully.
1,talk,23,1,13,...
1,talk,24,1,5,I think focusing on Jonathan or Minato makes sense.  @Mio  Jonathan got votes but didn't share much. Do you think he's wolf-like?
1,talk,25,1,9, @Sakura  you’ve barely spoken. Who’s your top suspect right now? Silence isn’t helping us  ZZZ.
1,talk,26,2,1,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,27,2,6,Dogpiling votes on Jonathan feels risky Wolves often hide while villagers focus on easy targets Shouldn’t we be more careful?
1,talk,28,2,10,I must admit. I harbor some doubts about those who dwell in the shadows. Minato's vote was indeed forceful without clear rationale.
1,talk,29,2,12,If we trust Toshio's Seer claim then Benjamin’s likely safe.  @Servas  @Minato are you voting Jonathan only for being quiet?
1,talk,30,2,7,Let's analyze the goal. Why are  @Servas  and @Minato voting for Jonathan without stating a reason?
1,talk,31,2,2,Minako’s death matters—one-sentence reads only. I’m watching the overly calm and the very quiet.  @Benjamin  you’ve been too calm—who are you leaning to lynch? I don’t want a rushed lynch without a role claim. Over
1,talk,32,2,3,I'm still shaken... I don't want to rush things  but  @Benjamin  you seem very calm—what's your read? I'll mostly listen. Over
1,talk,33,2,4,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,34,2,11, @Ryuji  a fascinating error. You mention Minako's death. From what perspective did you observe this?
1,talk,35,2,8,You know. I find the focus on Jonathan a bit suspect. Let me tell you. Pressing more on Mr. Servas and Minato would be wise.
1,talk,36,2,13,...
1,talk,37,2,5,George's spot on. Servas and Minato might be using Jonathan's silence. We should review the quieter folks first. Trust me.
1,talk,38,2,9, @Servas  @Minato your votes on Jonathan have no reasoning. If you can’t explain it looks like wolf coordination to me.
1,talk,39,3,1,I will vote Jonathan.
1,talk,40,3,6,Benjamin is safe per Toshio’s result. My vote goes to Servas—starting wagons without stating reasons feels suspicious.
1,talk,41,3,10,Let's ponder this together. Minato your voting process seems puzzling if you will. Do the others share this concern?
1,talk,42,3,12,I’m voting Servas. Silent votes against Jonathan feel like wolf tactics to me. We can check back on Jonathan tomorrow.
1,talk,43,3,7,The silent votes for Jonathan are suspicious. I support voting for Servas or Minato. My vote is Servas.

1,talk,47,3,11,Over
1,talk,48,3,8,Let me tell you. Servas's silent votes and Mr. Minato's repeated actions are suspicious. Both need a closer look today.  @Servas  Mr. Minato keeps voting for Jonathan without reason. Are you two coordinating? That seems wolf-like.
1,talk,49,3,13,...
1,talk,50,3,5,Servas gets my vote. His voting screams wolf to me. Others think so too. Sakura! Quiet won't help. What about Servas or Minato?
1,talk,51,3,9,Servas has stayed silent and dodged questions all day—I’m voting Servas. If you want a wolf today this is it.

2,talk,6,0,10,Mr. Toshio's claim to seership holds merit as it were. Perhaps he should divine Minato tonight given Minato's hasty tendencies.
2,talk,7,0,6,Relying on one Seer CO is risky; wolves could easily point us all in their chosen direction. How do we verify Toshio?
2,talk,8,0,8,You know Ms. Minako has a point. We shouldn't only depend on Mr. Toshio. Let us hear what Ryuji has to say before deciding.

2,talk,11,1,7,I see your caution  @Minako . However the wolves removed my human finding. This validates my data.
2,talk,12,1,12, @Ryuji  do you have any defense or claim? If not I lean toward voting you  but Sakura’s silence also worries me.
2,talk,13,1,5,I'm sure of it. Let's focus on Toshio today! Toshio's claim is key. I say we vote for Ryuji. If more comes up Jonathan's next.
2,talk,14,1,4,I will vote Jonathan.

2,talk,18,1,6,We’re putting all faith in Toshio but Sakura’s silence worries me. Shouldn’t we consider her as a possible wolf too?
2,talk,19,1,8,You know Mr. Shunichi before rushing into a vote let's verify Toshio's claim as Seer. Let me tell you Ryuji's silence is intriguing.

2,talk,24,2,5,Toshio seems genuine. Decisions can't rest on him alone. Sakura's silence matters too. Sakura! Any thoughts on who stands out?
2,talk,25,2,4,I will vote Jonathan.

2,talk,27,2,9, @Ryuji  Toshio says you're a werewolf. If that's not true you need to defend yourself or CO now.
2,talk,28,2,10,Informing us truthfully about roles is vital. Without communication we hinder our analysis and understanding of each vote.
2,talk,29,2,6,If we rely on just Toshio’s claim we might miss a silent wolf.  @Sakura  why so quiet when suspicion is flying?
2,talk,30,2,8,You know Mr. Toshio. Your focus on Ryuji is indeed intriguing. Perhaps a counterclaim could clarify matters and reveal the truth?

2,talk,33,3,7,To those in doubt: What was the anomalous objective in removing Benjamin? The answer confirms my data.
2,talk,34,3,12,I’m voting Ryuji. Toshio’s Seer claim stands unchallenged. If Ryuji isn’t wolf Sakura’s silence is my next focus.
2,talk,35,3,5,Ryuji buddy if you’ve got no defense you’re my vote. Sakura your silence is troubling. We need to hear from both of you now.
2,talk,36,3,4,I will vote Jonathan.
2,talk,37,3,2,Benjamin’s death changes priorities — we need specifics  not noise.  @Takumi  you were talkative earlier; who are you leaning to lynch and what evidence do you have? If it’s vague I’ll start watching the loud players more closely
2,talk,38,3,9,I’ll be blunt ZZZ—I’m voting  @Ryuji  unless he counters Toshio right now. If he’s not wolf it’s on Minato and Sakura next.

2,talk,40,3,6,Sakura’s silence worries me most today—I’m voting Sakura. Quiet play can easily hide a wolf.

3,talk,9,1,3,I'm really sorry about Ryuji and Mio... I don't have much to add. Let's wait for role claims.  @Shunichi   any thoughts? I'll mostly listen. Over
3,talk,10,1,10,Mr. Toshio assures us of Minato's humanity. Still I remain vigilant if you will. Together let us watch and listen carefully.
3,talk,11,1,9, @Sakura  Silence at this stage is suspicious. If you don’t speak up I’m voting you today  ZZZ.
3,talk,12,1,5,I'll go with Shunichi's plan. We need that Medium. Let's confirm Toshio's story. Who's stepping up? Trust me. It's crucial.
3,talk,13,1,6, @Sakura  your silence is worrying if you’re innocent give reasons now before we choose today’s vote target.
3,talk,14,1,8,Let me tell you. Your vote for Mr. Shunichi is intriguing. What compels you to choose him? Is there an issue with his approach?
3,talk,15,1,7,My analysis cleared Minato. Sakura your continued silence is the most suspicious data point remaining.
3,talk,16,1,13,...
3,talk,17,1,4,I will vote Shunichi.
3,talk,18,2,3,I'm really sorry... Losing so many is hard. I don't have much to say  but  @Shunichi  you've been quiet—any thoughts? I think we should wait for role claims before voting. I'll mostly listen. Over
3,talk,19,2,10,Shunichi voting Minato could deter focus. Let us remain unified and not divide efforts.  @Minato  You find Shunichi's actions notable?
3,talk,20,2,9, @Sakura  We need responses not silence. If you don’t speak up now you’ll be my vote target today.
3,talk,21,2,5,Toshio's spot feels secure. No counterclaim. Sakura being quiet is fishy. Might need to push on that. Minato. Why Shunichi? Explain it well!
3,talk,22,2,6,Sakura’s silence is suspicious. Wolves hide by not defending themselves. Shouldn’t we push for answers from her today?
3,talk,23,2,8,You know. Ms. Sakura's silence is quite unsettling. Let me tell you. We need some clarity here or I might consider voting myself.
3,talk,24,2,7,Instead of waiting for a Medium let us act on the clear anomaly of Sakura's continued silence.
3,talk,25,2,13,...
3,talk,26,2,4,I will vote Takumi.
3,talk,27,3,3,I'm still shaken and don't want to rush a lynch.  @Shunichi   what are your thoughts? I'll mostly listen. Over
3,talk,28,3,10,Sakura. I find your silence increasingly concerning. Perhaps we should converse today about your hesitance. It troubles me.
3,talk,29,3,9,With Minato cleared and no Medium claim Sakura stands out for absolute silence. I’m voting Sakura. Let’s end the guessing.
3,talk,30,3,5,Minato. Voting for Shunichi just like that is too weak. I'm sure of it. We gotta focus on Sakura. Silence is looking bad. Trust me.
3,talk,31,3,6,Sakura hasn’t given us any reason to trust her. Silent wolves are dangerous. I’ll vote Sakura today.
3,talk,32,3,8,Let me tell you. Ms. Sakura's silence is suspect. Without input it risks misleading us. Voting Sakura seems logical now. Mr. Minato. Choosing Takumi

4,talk,0,0,8,You know Ms. Minako. I've noticed the players leaving as well. Are you still feeling cautious? Has your view shifted at all?
4,talk,1,0,5,Minato keeps voting the same. Strange behavior. Anyone else thinks we should discuss this? I'm sure of it. Thoughts?
4,talk,2,0,9, @Jonathan  silence on Medium is helping the wolves. Claim your role or at least share your top suspect now.

4,talk,4,0,6, @Minato  your vote swaps every day with no clear reason. Can you explain your logic for us now?
4,talk,5,0,4,I will vote Minako.
4,talk,6,0,7,My analysis last night targeted George. The result was HUMAN.
4,talk,7,0,10,Minato's voting seems erratic. Let's indeed contemplate his intentions deeply. We must seek clarity in his reasoning if you will.
4,talk,8,1,8,You know Mr. Jonathan. Is Minato's hesitance due to unclear motives? Your insight might guide me. What troubles you exactly?
4,talk,9,1,5,We should let Toshio divine Daisuke next. I'm sure his cautious behavior hides something. Is everyone okay? Jonathan you mentioned Minato behaving
4,talk,10,1,9,If no one claims Medium now it's too risky. I say we focus on quiet players like  @Daisuke  or @Takumi ZZZ.
4,talk,11,1,3,I'm really sorry... I'm still shaken. I'm uneasy about  @Shunichi  — you've been quiet. Let's wait for role claims before voting. I'll mostly listen. Over
4,talk,12,1,6, @Minato  Your voting always changes with no explanation. Are you hiding something from the rest of us?
4,talk,13,1,4,I will vote Minako.
4,talk,14,1,7,Let us hypothesize. If Daisuke were an ally what is the logic behind his consistent silence?
4,talk,15,1,10,We must remain vigilant with Toshio's seer claims aligning with Benjamin now.  @Takumi  Pray tell do you see his divination aligning?
4,talk,16,2,8,You know Minato's decisions leave us puzzled. Let's discuss with others first. It's crucial we gain clarity before making any voting choices.
4,talk,17,2,5,Minato's votes are all over the place. I can't figure him out. Jonathan should divine him next. I'm sure of it! Agreed?
4,talk,18,2,9, @Daisuke  you keep dodging real suspects while asking others. Name your top wolf now or I’ll vote you  ZZZ.
4,talk,19,2,3,I'm really sorry... we've lost so many. I don't want to rush a lynch—let's wait for role claims.  @Shunichi  any thoughts? I'll mostly listen. Over
4,talk,20,2,6,Minato’s votes have always been suspicious. If we ignore that we might miss a crucial wolf.
4,talk,21,2,4,I will vote Minako.
4,talk,22,2,7,Daisuke's behavior is the most anomalous. He should be the target for today's removal.
4,talk,23,2,10,I find myself concerned. Minato rarely explains his votes. If Mr. Toshio's divination revealed him as human perhaps he merits further reflection.
4,talk,24,3,8,You know if Mr. Toshio's divinations hold true maybe observing quieter players like Mr. Jonathan or Mr. Daisuke offers insights. Mr. Jonathan are yo
4,talk,25,3,5,I see issues with Daisuke's honesty. We need to be clear. Let’s talk about who dodged questions. Jonathan. Do you think Toshio's visions are working?
4,talk,26,3,9, @Daisuke  I’m voting you today. Your shifts don’t add up and we need to act. Anyone disagree strongly speak now ZZZ.
4,talk,27,3,3,I'm sorry... we've lost so many.  @Shunichi  you've been very quiet—could you share your thoughts? Let's wait for role claims before voting. I'll mostly listen. Over
4,talk,28,3,6,Daisuke’s refusal to clarify his reasoning makes me uneasy. I’m voting Daisuke to protect the village.
