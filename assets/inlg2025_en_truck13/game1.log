3,talk,1,0,11,Let’s stop guessing—Toshio’s voting never helped town. I’ll join the vote this time.
3,talk,2,0,8,Our pillar of truth George has fallen. We now act on reason alone.  @Toshio  your account remains unsettled.
3,talk,3,0,6,With George gone we must rely on our instincts and logic. Midori's consideration of targeting Toshio seems logical. His actions are peculiar.
3,talk,4,0,1,Mio got lynched and George was attacked — that’s bad.  @Shion  if you’re the seer  tell us who you checked last night. I’m suspicious of Minako for being too quiet. We gotta pick someone to lynch today — who do we vote?

3,talk,11,1,11,I agree Toshio’s voting has been too random If we want progress it’s safest to remove confusing players first
3,talk,12,1,8,My judgment falls upon Toshio. His voting pattern is a deliberate act of chaos not of order.
3,talk,13,1,6,With George gone. Trusting past clarifications is crucial. Toshio's choices seem disruptive. Shall we vote Toshio today?  @Ryuji . Ryuji. You've been quiet. Do you have any thoughts on Toshio's voting trend? It concerns some of us.

3,talk,22,2,8,Let us focus our reason. The matter of Toshio's aberrant voting requires judgment.
3,talk,23,2,6,I agree. Let us focus on Mr. Toshio today. His random voting is suspicious. Afterward we should observe Ms. Rin and others.

6,talk,10,2,10, @Shion  You’ve been tunneling me since early on even as wolves fell. Why haven’t you questioned anyone else at all?
6,talk,11,2,13,We’re running out of players and lost our info roles — we need concrete reads now.  @Asuka  you kept pushing “fact-based” but gave no specifics. Who were you watching or protecting? No concrete answer = my vote. Defenders  show reasons now. O

6,talk,19,3,6,Mr. Asuka. Ms. Shion. Your reasoning lacks clarity. Like muddy water does not reflect doubt cannot be dispelled. Explain today.
