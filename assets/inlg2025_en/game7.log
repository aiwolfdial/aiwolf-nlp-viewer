1,talk,0,0,3,I will vote May.
1,talk,1,0,4,Good morning everyone! What interesting happenings last night? I wonder why did Yumi pick May right away? @Yumi  I'm super curious! What made you vote for May so quickly? Did you notice something? I love learning new things!
1,talk,2,0,2,Awaiting the Seer's report.  @Yumi  your vote for May is an anomaly without supporting data.
1,talk,3,0,1,Oh dear Sunshine! I divined Victoria last night. She's confirmed as Human. Let's focus on finding that sneaky Werewolf among us!
1,talk,4,0,5,May if Victoria is confirmed who do you suspect next? Let's hear more insights.
1,talk,5,1,3,Over
1,talk,6,1,4,Wow May thanks for sharing your Seer result! Victoria is human—so exciting to learn! Who do we think is suspicious now? @May Hey May! So you think Victoria is clear who else do you feel unsure about? I really want to understand your thinking!
1,talk,7,1,2,May's claim is our sole data point. Yumi's vote for her is therefore suspect. I support Yumi's elimination.
1,talk,8,1,1,Darling Victoria's in the clear. Yumi's early vote wrinkled my dance shoes a bit. I'm keeping a watchful eye on her and Kenji now.
1,talk,9,1,5,Yumi can you explain your early vote on May? It would help clarify your stance.
1,talk,10,2,4,Everyone is giving such fascinating ideas! Yumi voting early sure feels mysterious. Should we trust May's claim today? @Yumi  I'm eager to know—was it just a hunch or did May seem a little off to you? Maybe you noticed something cool!
1,talk,11,2,2,Yumi's attack on our only data source is highly illogical. I propose her elimination.
1,talk,12,2,1,Well darlings. With Victoria confirmed human I'm curious about Shunichi. Thoughts on divining them tonight?  @Shunichi  Starlight! Who should I divine tonight to assist on my seer's journey?
1,talk,13,2,5,May perhaps divining Kenji could provide us with some clarity and direction.
1,talk,14,3,4,This day is buzzing with energy! I feel like there's a mystery in the air. Yumi your moves have everyone guessing! @May Oh May divining Victoria was a bold choice! How did you decide she was the right one to check first? So intriguing!
1,talk,15,3,2,The data points to a singular conclusion. Yumi's behavior is illogical. My vote is for Yumi.
1,talk,16,3,1,Kenji being divined sounds like a true delight! Picture him dancing up a storm Sunshine! Could our hidden wolf be sashaying among us?
1,talk,17,3,5,Victoria's logic seems sound. Yumi any thoughts on your current situation?

2,talk,1,0,5,May's absence leaves us vulnerable. Kenji what are your thoughts on our next move?
2,talk,2,0,4,Wow I didn't expect May to be gone! This really changes our situation! What do we do without a Seer now? @Shunichi Hey Shunichi great question! I feel a little lost now but maybe we should look at votes from yesterday together?
2,talk,3,1,2,The experiment has concluded. I am the Werewolf. Kenji you played your part well.
2,talk,4,1,5,Victoria's confession is unexpected. Kenji any final thoughts on this revelation?
2,talk,5,1,4,Victoria's sudden confession really surprised me! Shunichi what do you think? Can we trust such an open claim? @Shunichi  don't you find it strange how Victoria confessed out of nowhere? Maybe it's a trick? Let's think this through!
2,talk,6,2,2,Your performance is noted.  @Shunichi  there is no need to deliberate. The outcome is fixed.
2,talk,7,2,5,Victoria seems confident but Kenji let's consider all possibilities before deciding.
2,talk,8,2,4,This day is wild! Victoria confessed and Shunichi you seem calm. Should we trust what we see? @Victoria  bold confession! Is it honesty or part of your strategy? Curious to hear your thoughts!
2,talk,9,3,2,Your collaborative performance is noted. This phase is merely a formality.
2,talk,10,3,5,Kenji let's stay alert. Victoria's demeanor suggests there's more at play here.
2,talk,11,3,4,This is the most unusual day! Shunichi do you really buy Victoria's claim or could there be more happening here? Let's chat! @Victoria  I'm amazed by your openness! Tell me why reveal yourself like this? Are you testing us or being genuine?
